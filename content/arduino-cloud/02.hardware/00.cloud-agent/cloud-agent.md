The [Arduino Cloud Agent](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome) is a plugin that you install on your computer, that enables serial communication between your board and the Arduino Cloud. This allows you to upload sketches, and read/write serial data to/from your board, via your web browser.

The Cloud Agent is a requirement to program your devices in the Arduino Cloud, and takes only a minute to install.

## Installation

When you configure a device or use the Cloud Editor, you will automatically receive a prompt to install the Cloud Agent. 

You can also access the download page through [this link](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome). It should look like this:
