The default Arduino / C++ library for the Arduino Cloud is the [ArduinoIoTCloud](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoIoTCloud) library. This library depends on the [Arduino_ConnectionHandler](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_ConnectionHandler) library which provides connection via various wireless protocols (Wi-Fi®, LoRa® technology, NB-IoT, GSM, Ethernet). 

The library is integrated into the Arduino Cloud platform, where [Automatic Sketch Generation](/arduino-cloud/cloud-interface/sketches#iot-sketches) converts your Thing configurations into a set files that relies on aforementioned libraries.

The **ArduinoIoTCloud** library supports either connection via **TCP/IP** or using **LoRa® technology**. Depending on the device you compile for, the library automatically chooses the right configuration.

## Connection Methods

The ArduinoIoTCloud library supports both connection via TCP/IP and via LoRa®-based networks, which is enabled via the `ArduinoIoTCloudTCP` and `ArduinoIoTCloudLPWAN` classes. Depending on what [device you configure](/arduino-cloud/hardware/devices), the library will automatically choose the right class, which will externally be available in your sketch file as `ArduinoCloud` class.

### TCP / MQTT

When connecting via [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) stack, the library communicates with the Arduino Cloud via [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT), a lightweight network protocol using a publish/subscribe method to send data. This support is enabled in the following files:
- [ArduinoIoTCloudTCP.cpp](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoIoTCloud/blob/master/src/ArduinoIoTCloudTCP.cpp)
- [ArduinoIoTCloudTCP.h](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoIoTCloud/blob/master/src/ArduinoIoTCloudTCP.h)

### LoRa®-Based Network

When connecting via LoRa®-based network, data is sent via [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), which is integrated with the Arduino Cloud. This support is enabled in the following files:
- [ArduinoIoTCloudLPWAN.cpp](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoIoTCloud/blob/master/src/ArduinoIoTCloudLPWAN.cpp)
- [ArduinoIoTCloudLPWAN.h](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoIoTCloud/blob/master/src/ArduinoIoTCloudLPWAN.h)

## Library API Docs

The documentation lives in the [ArduinoIoTCloud](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoIoTCloud) library documentation page. Here you will find all public methods that are available. 

Most of its functions are already pre-configured in your sketch files, so for most use cases you will not need to explore the API. Functions for connecting to, and syncing data with the Arduino Cloud is handled automatically, and will be generated into your sketch files in the web environment. 

## Arduino IDE (Offline)

This library can be used with the offline version of the Arduino IDE (download through the [Arduino Downloads Page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)). You can program your devices offline and monitor them via the Cloud, but your Thing configuration is not synchronized if you do so.

To use it offline, you will manually need to install the following libraries in the Arduino IDE:
- [ArduinoIoTCloud](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoIoTCloud)
- [Arduino_ConnectionHandler](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_ConnectionHandler)

## Events & Callbacks

Arduino Cloud has support for events and callbacks. This can be used to trigger specific functionalities depending on what state your device is in. 

You can for example trigger a specific block of code whenever the board is in a **connecting**, **synchronized** or **disconnected** state. In this document, we will explore how to set it up, using an example from the [ArduinoIoTCloud](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoIoTCloud/blob/master/examples/ArduinoIoTCloud-Callbacks/ArduinoIoTCloud-Callbacks.ino) library.   

### Events

The `ArduinoIoTCloudEvent` enumeration class has three possible events:
- `CONNECT` (0) - Board successfully connects to Arduino Cloud.
- `SYNC` (1) - Data is successfully synced between Board and Arduino Cloud.
- `DISCONNECT` (2) -  Board has lost connection to Arduino Cloud.

The `CONNECT` and `DISCONNECT` events can occur even though no variable is created inside the Thing. However, `SYNC` requires a variable to be created, as this triggers whenever data is synchronized between the board and Cloud.

These events can be subscribed to using the `addCallback()` function, which is documented in the next section.

### Callbacks

Callbacks can be added for each event, and essentially triggers a custom function whenever the event occurs.

Callbacks are added via the `addCallback()` method from the `ArduinoIoTCloud` class, where the **event** and **custom function** are added as parameters. 

```arduino
ArduinoCloud.addCallback(ArduinoIoTCloudEvent::CONNECT, doThisOnConnect);
```

The above code will trigger the `doThisOnConnect()`
function whenever the `CONNECT` event occurs.

***Please note that callback functions should be added inside the `setup()` of your sketch.***

### Full Example
