MicroPython is an implementation of the popular Python programming language, with a target for microcontrollers (hence the "micro").

Python has become one of the most popular languages worldwide, with one of its key characteristics being an easier language to learn. This makes it suitable for beginners that have little to no experience in writing text-based code but want to achieve great things.

## Nano ESP32 / MicroPython Pinout

The pins used in MicroPython are very different from what the pin numbering on your board states. In the pinout below, you can see in **green**, which pins you need to use when using MicroPython.

Why is there a difference in pins? The MicroPython implementation follows the pin numbering on the ESP32-S3, making it compatible with all other boards based on the ESP32-S3.

Therefore it is necessary to keep track on two sets of pins:
- The **Nano ESP32 pins** which are labeled on the board.
- The **MicroPython pins** which are used in the code.

## The MicroPython Environment

MicroPython includes the standard Python API, but also a series of modules that are hardware specific. After you have installed it in your board, commands written in Python that you send to the board will be executed directly.

This is quite different from the "standard" Arduino (C++) way of programming, where you compile your code before sending it to your board. The MicroPython way allows you to change the program instantly.

When using MicroPython, we don't write sketches, we write **scripts**. A script can be written in a [MicroPython compatible editor](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython) which can then be saved on the board. To send a script, you need to have the board connected to your computer.

Since MicroPython implements a filesystem, you can access your board similar to how you access a USB drive.

## MicroPython Editor

A MicroPython editor is a special code editor with built-in functions for communicating with your board.

There are several editors available, but in this course, we will use the [Arduino Lab for MicroPython](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython).

***The [next chapter](/micropython-course/course/installation) is dedicated to using the Arduino Lab for MicroPython editor.***

## What is a Script?

A MicroPython script is a piece of code that can be run on your board. It could contain just the simplest mathematic equation, `1+1` (which is 2), or a script that controls a robotic arm that serves you a cup of tea.

Inside a MicroPython editor, you simply write the code you want to run and click on the **"Play"** button. If there is anything wrong with your code, you will receive an error. If not, it will run the instructions in the scripts.

## Loops

If you have plenty of experience in Arduino, you will be used to the concept of a **loop**. This is not a requirement when using MicroPython. You can write a program that either just runs once, or continues to loop over and over.

To make a program loop continuously, you will need to use a **while loop** inside your script.

```python
while(True):
    # code placed here will execute over and over again
    # in a similar fashion to the void loop() function
```

## Main & Boot Files

There are two files that are important to consider in the MicroPython environment:
- `boot.py` - a script that will run as the board starts (in other words, *boots*).
- `main.py` - a script that will run immediately after `main.py`.

You can consider `main.py` file to be your "main" script as it will execute any time after the board boots. Inside a MicroPython editor, we can open this file and edit it directly. When we save, we save it to the board, and the instructions are updated.

This is a bit different if you are used to programming Arduino boards using the Arduino IDE / C++ because there you need to compile and upload for every change you make.

## REPL

The **REPL**, also often referred to as the **terminal**, is a command line interface inside your editor. When you input instructions or a message, the *interpreter* on your Arduino will evaluate it, and return the result.

You could for example write `1+1`, which the REPL will reply with a `2`. This computation is performed on your Arduino, and sent back to you!

![Short video / GIF of this in action in the REPL](assets/repl.gif)

When we run a script, and don't worry, we will come back to this topic, we can use the `print()` function to print things in the REPL. This is a great way of knowing what goes on on your board. An example is:

```python
print(1+1)
print("Computation performed, yay!")
```

## Modules

As you progress with MicroPython, you will come across a very important term: **modules**.

Modules are code files that can be imported into your script which provides an additional set of functionalities. For example, the `time` module allows you to control how often something should occur, or the `machine` module contains hardware specific functions. To use a module, we can simply `import` it in the script, as follows:

```python
# import the "time" module
import time

# import the "pin" function from the "machine" module
from machine import Pin
```

Once the module is imported, you can use it in your script, like:

```python
import time

# freeze the program for one second
time.sleep(1)
```

## External Modules

Not all modules out there are built-in to the MicroPython installation. This would be impossible because we have a very limited memory space.

For example, to use a module for a specific sensor, we need to install it **externally**. Installing external modules can be done in several different ways, but below we will demonstrate a safe and straightforward approach.

### Install External Modules

To install an external module, we are going to use something called `mip`. With `mip`, we can install a module on the board directly, by connecting to Wi-Fi and downloading the module directly to the board. So how do we do this?

Below is a script that first connects to Wi-Fi, and then downloads a specific module. In this case, we will provide a URL to a file stored on GitHub (the raw file). In this case, we will install the `lis3dh` module, which will be used later on in this course.

Please note that you need to add your own Wi-Fi network and password in the `WIFI_NETWORK` and `WIFI_PASSWORD` fields.

```python
"""
This script first connects to Wi-Fi,
then installs the module specified
in the URL variable.
"""

import network
import mip

WIFI_NETWORK='YOUR_NETWORK_NAME'
WIFI_PASSWORD='YOUR_NETWORK_PASSWORD'

# add the URL of the module you want to install
URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinypico/tinypico-micropython/master/lis3dh%20library/lis3dh.py"

wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)
wlan.connect(WIFI_NETWORK, WIFI_PASSWORD)

print()
print("Connected to ",WIFI_NETWORK)

mip.install(URL)
```

Once you run the script successfully, you will have installed the module on your board.

***If you want to uninstall a module, you can delete it in the editor using the "Files" tab. This is a good idea to do if you have installed many modules, as eventually you will run out of memory space.***

### Troubleshooting

**1. Invalid URL:** if you have specified an invalid URL, you will get an error that looks like this:

```
Package not found: https://micropython.org/pi/v2/package/6/<url>/latest.json
```

Double check to make sure your URL is correct if this occurs.

**2. OSError: -202:**

The following error is known to occur when running the installation script. Please try re-launching the script (typically works on second attempt).

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 24, in <module>
  File "mip/__init__.py", line 1, in install
  File "mip/__init__.py", line 1, in _install_package
  File "mip/__init__.py", line 1, in _install_json
  File "urequests.py", line 180, in get
  File "urequests.py", line 76, in request
OSError: -202
```
