The [LiquidCrystal library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/liquidcrystal/) allows you to control LCD displays that are compatible with the Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of them out there, and you can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface.

![Output of the sketch on a 16x2 LCD](assets/lcd_photo.png)

The LCDs have a parallel interface, meaning that the microcontroller has to manipulate several interface pins at once to control the display. The interface consists of the following pins:

- A **register select (RS) pin** that controls where in the LCD's memory you're writing data to. You can select either the data register, which holds what goes on the screen, or an instruction register, which is where the LCD's controller looks for instructions on what to do next.
- A **Read/Write (R/W) pin** that selects reading mode or writing mode
- An **Enable pin** that enables writing to the registers
- 8 **data pins (D0 -D7)**. The states of these pins (high or low) are the bits that you're writing to a register when you write, or the values you're reading when you read.

There's also a **display contrast pin (Vo)**, **power supply pins (+5V and GND)** and **LED Backlight (Bklt+ and BKlt-)** pins that you can use to power the LCD, control the display contrast, and turn on and off the LED backlight, respectively.

The process of controlling the display involves putting the data that form the image of what you want to display into the data registers, then putting instructions in the instruction register.  The [LiquidCrystal Library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/liquidcrystal/) simplifies this for you so you don't need to know the low-level instructions.

The Hitachi-compatible LCDs can be controlled in two modes: 4-bit or 8-bit. The 4-bit mode requires seven I/O pins from the Arduino, while the 8-bit mode requires 11 pins.  For displaying text on the screen, you can do most everything in 4-bit mode, so example shows how to  control a 16x2 LCD in 4-bit mode.

## Hardware Required

- Arduino Board
- LCD Screen (compatible with Hitachi HD44780 driver)
- pin headers to solder to the LCD display pins
- 10k ohm potentiometer
- 220 ohm resistor
- hook-up wires
- breadboard

## Circuit

***Note that this circuit was originally designed for the Arduino UNO. As the Arduino is communicating with the display using [SPI](), pin 11 & 12 will change depending on what board you are using. For example, on a MKR WiFi 1010, the SPI bus is attached to pin 8 & 11.***

Before wiring the LCD screen to your Arduino board we suggest to solder a pin header strip to the 14 (or 16) pin count connector of the LCD screen, as you can see in the image further up.

To wire your LCD screen to your board, connect the following pins:

- LCD RS pin to digital pin 12
- LCD Enable pin to digital pin 11
- LCD D4 pin to digital pin 5
- LCD D5 pin to digital pin 4
- LCD D6 pin to digital pin 3
- LCD D7 pin to digital pin 2
- LCD R/W pin to GND
- LCD VSS pin to GND
- LCD VCC pin to 5V
- LCD LED+ to 5V through a 220 ohm resistor
- LCD LED- to GND

Additionally, wire a 10k potentiometer to +5V and GND, with it's wiper (output) to LCD screens VO pin (pin3).

```

### Autoscroll Example

This example sketch shows how to use the `autoscroll()` and `noAutoscroll()` methods to move all the text on the display left or right. 

- `autoscroll()` moves all the text one space to the left each time a letter is added
- `noAutoscroll()` turns scrolling off

This sketch prints the characters `0` to `9` with autoscroll off, then moves the cursor to the bottom right, turns autoscroll on, and prints them again.

}
```

### Display Example

This example sketch shows how to use the `display()` and `noDisplay()` methods to turn on and off the display. The text to be displayed will still be preserved when you use noDisplay() so it's a quick way to blank the display without losing everything on it.

```arduino

### Scroll Example

This example sketch shows how to use the `scrollDisplayLeft()` and `scrollDisplayRight()` methods to reverse the direction the text is flowing.  It prints "Hello World!", scrolls it offscreen to the left, then offscreen to the right, then back to home.

      // display each character to the LCD
      lcd.write(Serial.read());

}
```

### Set Cursor Example

This example sketch shows how to use the `setCursor()` method to reposition the cursor.  To move the cursor, just call `setCursor()` with a row and column position. For example, for a 2x16 display:

```arduino
lcd.setCursor(0, 0); // top left
lcd.setCursor(15, 0); // top right
lcd.setCursor(0, 1); // bottom left
lcd.setCursor(15, 1); // bottom right
```

Here is the full example:

### Text Direction Example

This example sketch shows how to use the `leftToRight()` and `rightToLeft()` methods. These methods control which way text flows from the cursor.

- `rightToLeft()` causes text to flow to the left from the cursor, as if the display is right-justified.
- `leftToRight()` causes text to flow to the right from the cursor, as if the display is left-justified.

This sketch prints `a` through `l` right to left, then `m` through `r` left to right, then `s` through `z` right to left again.

### Custom Character

This example demonstrates how to add custom characters on an LCD  display. 

Note that this example requires an additional potentiometer:
- Outer pins connected to 5V and GND.
- Inner pin (wiper) connected to A0.

This potentiometer controls the `delayTime` variable.
