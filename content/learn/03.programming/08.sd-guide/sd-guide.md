This guide collects compatible hardware and great code examples that you can use if you want to get started with Secure Digital (SD) cards. 

***The examples in this guide comes from the [SD Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SD), which originally is based on [SdFat](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat) by William Greiman.***

## Hardware & Software Required

- Arduino Board with SD Card Slot\*
- Arduino IDE ([online](https://create.arduino.cc/) or [offline](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)).
- Formatted SD Card

\*The boards/shields that have an SD card slot are listed below:

- [MKR Zero](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mkr-zero-i2s-bus-sd-for-sound-music-digital-audio-data)
- [MKR IoT Carrier](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mkr-iot-carrier)
- [MKR MEM Shield](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mkr-mem-shield)
- [MKR SD Proto Shield](https://store.arduino.cc/products/mkr-proto-shield)
- [MKR ENV Shield](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mkr-env-shield-rev2)
- [MKR Ethernet Shield](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-ethernet-shield-2)
- [Arduino Education Shield](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-education-shield)


## Circuit

Here is an example of how to insert an SD card into the MKR Zero board. None of the examples below requires any additional circuit.

## Examples

Below are a series of examples

### Read and Write

This example shows how to read and write data to and from an SD card.

- In `setup()`, create a new file with `SD.open()` named "test.txt". `FILE_WRITE` enables read and write access to the file, starting at the end. If a file `"test.txt"` was already on the card, that file would be opened.
- Name the instance of the opened file "myFile".
- Once opened, use `myFile.println()` to write a string to the card, followed by a carriage return. Once the content is written, close the file.
- Again, open the file with `SD.open()`.  Once opened, ask the Arduino to read the contents of the file with `SD.read()` and send them over the serial port. After all the contents of the file are read, close the file with `SD.close()`.

***Note that pin 4 is default Chip Select (CS) pin for most boards. To set CS for MKR Zero, you can use 28 instead of 4, alt. use the SDCARD_SS_PIN definition.***

    // read from the file until there's nothing else in it:

  } else {

  // nothing happens after setup

```

### Card Information

This example shows how to read information about a SD card. The example reports volume type, free space and other information using the SD library, sending it over the serial port.

```arduino

/*

  This example shows how use the utility libraries on which the'

  SD library is based in order to get info about your SD card.

  Very useful for testing a card when you're not sure whether its working or not.

***Please note: the cluster size is defined at format time by the user and has some default values that can be changed by users following some rules. In the sketch above we are using the default size for a block that is set at 512 bytes by standards. This value is not the cluster size: that is calculated as the number of blocks per cluster.  You may find more in depth information about cluster sizes [in this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20240309213220/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/default-cluster-size-for-ntfs-fat-and-exfat-9772e6f1-e31a-00d7-e18f-73169155af95).***

### Dump File

This example shows how to read a file from a SD card using the SD library and send it over the serial port.

On the SD card, there is a file named "datalog.txt". In the `loop()`, the file is opened when calling `SD.open()`. To send the file serially to a computer, use `Serial.print()`, reading the contents of the file with `SD.read()`.

  // wait for Serial Monitor to connect. Needed for native USB port boards only:

  while (!Serial);

  Serial.print("Initializing SD card...");

  if (!SD.begin(chipSelect)) {

    Serial.println("initialization failed. Things to check:");

    Serial.println("1. is a card inserted?");

    Serial.println("2. is your wiring correct?");

    Serial.println("3. did you change the chipSelect pin to match your shield or module?");

    Serial.println("Note: press reset or reopen this serial monitor after fixing your issue!");

    while (true);

  }

  Serial.println("initialization done.");

  // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,

  // so you have to close this one before opening another.

  File dataFile = SD.open("datalog.txt");

  // if the file is available, write to it:

  if (dataFile) {

    while (dataFile.available()) {

      Serial.write(dataFile.read());

  }

  // if the file isn't open, pop up an error:

  else {

    Serial.println("error opening datalog.txt");

  }
}

void loop() {
}
```

### File Management

This example shows how to create and destroy a file on a SD card.

In the `setup()`, open a new file with `SD.open()` named "example.txt". `FILE_WRITE` enables read and write access to the file, starting at the end. In this example though, immediately close the file by calling `myFile.close()`.

After checking to make sure the file exists with `SD.exists()`, delete the file from the card with `SD.remove`.

while (!Serial);

  Serial.print("Initializing SD card...");

  if (!SD.begin(10)) {

    Serial.println("initialization failed!");

    while (1);

  }

  Serial.println("initialization done.");

  if (SD.exists("example.txt")) {

    Serial.println("example.txt exists.");

  } else {

    Serial.println("example.txt doesn't exist.");

  }

  // open a new file and immediately close it:

  Serial.println("Creating example.txt...");

  myFile = SD.open("example.txt", FILE_WRITE);

  myFile.close();

  // Check to see if the file exists:

  if (SD.exists("example.txt")) {

    Serial.println("example.txt exists.");

  } else {

    Serial.println("example.txt doesn't exist.");

  }

  } else {

    Serial.println("example.txt doesn't exist.");

  }
}

void loop() {

  // nothing happens after setup finishes.
}
```

### List Files

This example shows how to list the files available in the directory of the SD card.

The main `loop()` does nothing because the function that prints out the file directory of "/" of the SD card is called from the `setup()`. This because we need to see it just once.

The `printDirectory` function scans through the list of entries and prints on serial every file and directory present. For files the size is printed as well.
