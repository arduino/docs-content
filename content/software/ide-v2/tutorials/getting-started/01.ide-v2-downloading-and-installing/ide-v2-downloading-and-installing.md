## Downloading and Installing the Arduino IDE 2

In this tutorial, we will show how to download and install the Arduino IDE 2 on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.

You can easily download the editor from the [Arduino Software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). 

### Requirements

- **Windows** - Win 10 and newer, 64 bits
- **Linux** - 64 bits
- **macOS** - Version 10.15: "Catalina" or newer, 64 bits

### The Arduino IDE 2

The Arduino IDE 2 is an open-source project. It is a big step from its sturdy predecessor, Arduino IDE 1.x, and comes with revamped UI, improved board & library manager, debugger, autocomplete feature and much more. 

### Download the Editor

Downloading the Arduino IDE 2 is done through the [Arduino Software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Here you will also find information on the other editors available to use. 

### Installation

#### Windows

To install the Arduino IDE 2 on a Windows computer, simply run the file downloaded from the software page.

You can now use the Arduino IDE 2 on your macOS computer!

#### Linux 

To install the Arduino IDE 2 on Linux, first download the **AppImage 64 bits (X86-64)** from the [Arduino Software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). 

Before we can launch the editor, we need to first make it an **executable file**. This is done by:
- right-click the file,
- choose **Properties**,
- select **Permissions** tab, 
- tick the **Allow executing file as program** box.

You can now double click the file to launch the Arduino IDE 2 on your Linux machine. In case you cannot run the AppImage file, make sure that FUSE is installed on your system.

In Ubuntu (>= 22.04):
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt install libfuse2
```

In Fedora
```bash
dnf install fuse
```

See instructions for installing FUSE on your distribution [here](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE).

To enable the Arduino IDE to access the serial port and upload code to your board, the following rule can be added to `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-arduino.rules`. 
```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0666"
```
