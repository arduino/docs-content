- [Arduino IDE 1.8.10+](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), [Arduino IDE 2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), [Arduino Cloud Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor) or any program with a serial monitor in case you need to retrieve the _Hardware-ID_ of your device.

***To get the Arduino PLC IDE for your device, please visit the [Arduino software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). In case you are using a Portenta Machine Control, you need to acquire a PLC IDE License at the [store page](https://store.arduino.cc/plc-key-portenta-machine-control).***

## Instructions

To get the Arduino PLC IDE software, go to the [official software website of the Arduino PLC IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/software-plc-ide) and choose to download the PLC IDE installer file. The software is named `Arduino PLC IDE Installer`.

![Arduino IDE Download page](assets/IdeDownloadPage.png)

The software requires **Windows 10** or a newer operating system version for the x64 architecture.

The Arduino PLC IDE installer contains the IDE and all the required drivers, libraries, and cores. The continuing sections will help you install the Arduino PLC IDE software properly.

***Before installing the Arduino PLC IDE 1.0.6, remove both the PLC IDE 1.0.3 and PLC IDE Tools 1.0.3 from Windows using the "Add or remove programs" tool. Also, remove the folder "T" found on the directory (C:&#92;Users&#92;<your username\>&#92;AppData&#92;Local&#92;T).***

### 1. Arduino PLC IDE Setup

When you download the Arduino PLC IDE installer, the file naming scheme is as follows:

`Arduino-PLC-IDE-Installer_X.X.X_Windows_64bit`

If you have the correct IDE software, its name should include the version format `X.X.X`. For instance, a version example might look like `1.0.6`. Thus, a complete installer name should resemble the following:

`Arduino-PLC-IDE-Installer_1.0.6_Windows_64bit`

Run the Arduino PLC IDE installer after verifying that the installer naming scheme follows the above software nomenclature. It helps ensure the software package is legitimate and the latest version available.

***__To ensure a smooth and reliable installation, it is recommended to temporarily disable any antivirus software and run the installation with administrative privileges.__ During the installation, you may notice several terminal windows opening automatically. These are necessary for the installation process to load all required resources onto your computer successfully, so there is no need to be concerned.***

The installation process starts with a window that prompts you to begin. Click **Install** to proceed:

![PLC IDE - Beginning Installation](assets/plcide-install-1.png)

The installation will begin with the **PLC IDE Tools**. Click **Next** to continue:

![PLC IDE - PLC IDE Tools](assets/plcide-install-2.png)

Select a directory for installing the **PLC IDE Tools** and then click **Next**:

![PLC IDE - PLC IDE Tools Directory](assets/plcide-install-3.png)

Click **Install** to install the **PLC IDE Tools** in the chosen directory:

![PLC IDE - PLC IDE Tools Installation](assets/plcide-install-4.png)

Following the **PLC IDE Tools** installation, set up the **PLC IDE software** by choosing an installation directory and following the instructions:

![PLC IDE - PLC IDE Directory](assets/plcide-install-5.png)

A confirmation window will indicate the completion of the **PLC IDE software** installation:

The following sections will guide you through creating a project, downloading the runtime, and properly interfacing the Portenta Machine Control or Opta™ with its dedicated license activation procedure.

### 2. Project Setup

Create a new project by clicking the middle **New project ...** button or **File > New Project**.

![Create new project](assets/newProjectFullScreen.png)

After creating the project, there are some new windows on the screen; click on the left panel and switch it to the **Resources tab** inside the window on the tree structure. Now click on your board, it will open the **Boards configuration page**.

![Board configuration page](assets/projectWelcome.png)

### 3. Download the Runtime

The board needs to run a specific program (runtime) to interact with the **PLC IDE**. Go to the **"Other"** section below the **"Device Info"** block.

Plug your device to the computer, select your board's Serial Port, and click the **Download** button.

![Board runtime upload](assets/runtime.png)

***Download the runtime every time you update the PLC IDE from a previous version.***

***The device will display two Serial Ports: the default port, typically with the lowest number, and the secondary port, usually with the highest number. The default port is the usual Serial port and a virtual port for Modbus communication between the device and your computer. If the default port with the lowest number cannot establish a connection, please note the port number assigned to the secondary port, as it will be needed in a subsequent step.***

If the following message appears during the download procedure, double-tap the reset button using the tip of a pen or a similar pointed object. The LED above the reset button for Opta™ or the Digital Outputs LEDs for Portenta Machine control will start blinking, indicating that the device is ready to be flashed with new firmware. Click the **Download** button to begin the process again.

![Download error message](assets/downloadSketchError.png)

***If you persistently experience issues during the download procedure or related processes, try launching the PLC IDE with __administrative privileges__. This can help resolve permission related problems that may prevent download procedures or device interactions.***

### 4. Connect to the Device

After the runtime is up and running, set up the communication by going to **On-line > Set up communication**.

![Set up communication](assets/onlineSetupButton.png)

On the new popup window, open the properties of the Modbus protocol.

![Properties of the communication](assets/onlineSetup.png)

Ensure the Modbus protocol uses the default Serial port number as the initial option, the Modbus Virtual port you noted before. Use the secondary Serial port number number for additional devices or those with higher Serial number series if applicable. Press OK.

![Online Activation Forgotten Key Activated](assets/activation-online_resized.png)

### 8. Getting the Hardware-ID of Your Device

The hardware ID of your device is an important number to save in case you have problems with the divide or your PLC IDE license. To get the unique Hardware-ID of your device, follow the next steps:

- Be sure that your device is disconnected from the Arduino PLC IDE
- Open the **Arduino IDE** software
- Go to **Tools** > **Board** > **Arduino Mbed OS Portenta Boards** > **Arduino Portenta H7 (M7 Core)**
- Go to **Tools** > **Port** to select the proper port (the default one shown before in the PLC IDE inside the **Arduino PMC Configuration** > **Other** section)
- Go to **Tools** > **Serial Monitor** and reset the board. Look at the end of the boot report to find the "Hardware-ID" and store it in a safe place.

### 9. Download a Program

Let's download and run the first program on your device. We are going to use the default program that is included in a project: a counter.

Double-click on the file _main_ inside the _Project_ to see the counter program. To download that program to your PLC, you must compile it and send it to the target device.

![Send the program to the device (download)](assets/downloadCode.png)

### 10. Communication Test

Open the **Watch** window by clicking "View > Tool Windows > Watch". It will attach a new window on the right side called **Watch**. This window shows the real-time variables value.

To add a variable to be watched, click the **Insert new item** button inside the window. It will open a popup window; on the name label, insert "cnt" and click OK on the location "main". It will add the variable `cnt` from the `main` program on the table or drag and drop the `cnt` variable from the **Project** tree or from the **Main** program.

Select the **Watch** window and click on the **Start/Stop watch button** unless the variable's value is already getting updated.

## Conclusions

In this tutorial, we went through how to set up the Portenta Machine Control or Opta™ with the Arduino IDE lab, learned how to connect the board to the program through Modbus, activate the hardware license of your product, and create a simple sketch with one variable that went compiled and downloaded inside the board. Finally, we learned how to see the values of the variables in real time using the **Watch** window.

You can create professional solutions now that your board is running with the Arduino PLC IDE.
