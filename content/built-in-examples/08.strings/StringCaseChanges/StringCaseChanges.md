The [String](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/StringObject) case change functions allow you to change the case of a String. They work just as their names imply. `toUpperCase()` changes the whole string to upper case characters, and `toLowerCase()` changes the whole String to lower case characters.  Only the characters A to Z or a to z are affected.

### Hardware Required

- [Arduino Board](https://store.arduino.cc/collections/boards-modules)

### Circuit

There is no circuit for this example, though your board must be connected to your computer via USB and the serial monitor window of the Arduino Software (IDE) should be open.
