In this tutorial, we will create our very first MicroPython script that will run on an Arduino board. Starting of simple, we will make an LED blink, a classic beginner project that will get us familiar with the MicroPython programming environment.

## Requirements

Before we start, let's check the requirements:

### MicroPython Compatible Arduino Boards

MicroPython is officially supported on several Arduino boards. Hereâ€™s a list of the compatible boards:

- [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense-rev2)
- [Arduino Nano ESP32](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-esp32)


### Software Requirements

- [Arduino Lab for Micropython](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython) - Arduino Lab for MicroPython is an editor where we can create and run MicroPython scripts on our Arduino board.

***Note that the editor is also available online, at [Arduino Cloud - Arduino Labs for MicroPython](https://lab-micropython.arduino.cc/)***

## Board and Editor Setup

1. Open the [Arduino Lab for MicroPython]() application.
2. Plug the Arduino board into the computer using a USB cable.
    ![Connect board to computer.](assets/usb-comp.png)
3. Press the connection button on the top left corner of the window. The connected Arduino board should appear (by its port name), and we can click it:

## First Script (LED Blink)

Once your board is connected, we can start writing code! Below you will find a basic example, that will flash the built in LED on your board every second. 

1. First, open the `main.py` file on your board. We write in this file, because once saved, the code will run even if you reset the board.
   ![Open main.py file.](assets/open-files.png)

2. Copy and paste the following code into your editor:
  ```python
  import machine
  import time

  # The pin used for built-in LED varies
  # GIGA: 0 (green), Nano ESP32: 0 (green), Nano RP2040 Connect: 25
  # Nano BLE Sense: 13
  led = machine.Pin(25, machine.Pin.OUT)

  while True:
      led.value(1)
      time.sleep(1)
      led.value(0)
      time.sleep(1)
  ```

  ***Note: The built-in LED pin varies from board to board. For example, on the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect, the built-in LED is on pin `25`.***

3. Click the **Run** button in your editor to transfer the script to your board.
   ![Run the script.](assets/run-script.png)

Once the script is running, the LED on the board should start blinking at one-second intervals. This means our MicroPython script has loaded successfully.

### Code Breakdown

Let's take a look at the code, line by line, to understand what is happening:

- **Import Modules**:

  ```python
  import machine
  import time
  ```

  We import the `machine` and `time` modules to access hardware functions and time delays.

- **Initialize the LED Pin**:

  ```python
  led = machine.Pin(25, machine.Pin.OUT)
  ```

  We create a `Pin` object named `led`, set to pin number `25`, and configure it as an output.

- **Infinite Loop**:

  ```python
  while True:
      led.value(1)
      time.sleep(1)
      led.value(0)
      time.sleep(1)
  ```

  Inside the loop, we:

  - Turn the LED on by setting its value to `1`.
  - Wait for 1 second.
  - Turn the LED off by setting its value to `0`.
  - Wait for another second.
  - Repeat the cycle.

## Understanding Programming Concepts

Let's break down the key programming concepts used in this script:

### `machine` Module

The machine module is a built-in MicroPython library that provides direct access to your board's hardware components. It allows you to control and interact with the microcontroller's features, such as:

- **Pins:** Configure and control digital and analog pins.
- **Timers:** Set up timers for scheduling tasks.
- **Communication Interfaces:** Use protocols like I2C, SPI, and UART.
- **Hardware-Specific Functions:** Access features unique to your microcontroller.

In our script, we use the `machine.Pin` class to interact with a specific pin on the board. By creating a `Pin` object, we can control the voltage level of that pin, which in turn controls the LED.

### `time` Module

The time module provides functions for managing time-related tasks. It allows you to add delays, measure time intervals, and schedule events. Key functions include:

- `time.sleep(seconds)` Pauses the execution of your script for the specified number of seconds. It accepts floating-point numbers for sub-second delays.

### `while True` Loop

A `while True` loop creates an infinite loop, allowing the code inside it to run repeatedly. This is essential for tasks that need to run continuously, like blinking an LED.

## Modification: Make the LED Blink Faster

Let's modify the script to make the LED blink faster. We'll change the delay from 1 second to 0.2 seconds.

### Modified Code

```python
import machine
import time

led = machine.Pin(25, machine.Pin.OUT)

while True:
    led.value(1)
    time.sleep(0.5) # 0.5 seconds
    led.value(0)
    time.sleep(0.5) # 0.5 seconds
```

### Steps

1. Change the `time.sleep(1)` lines to `time.sleep(0.5)`.
2. Upload the modified script to your board.
3. Observe that the LED now blinks faster, turning on and off every 0.5 seconds.

## Summary

Great work! We have now written and modified our first MicroPython script on an Arduino board. This exercise introduced:

- Importing modules (`machine`, `time`)
- Initializing hardware components (LED)
- Using loops (`while`)
- Controlling time delays (`time.sleep()`)

These concepts are key for a vast majoraty of operations we can perform while writing MicroPython programs.
