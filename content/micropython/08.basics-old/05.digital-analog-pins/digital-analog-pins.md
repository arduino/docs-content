In this chapter we will learn about managing digital and analog pins. 

All the compatible boards have a series of pins, most of these pins work as a general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pin. There are Digital Pins and Analog Pins depending on the signal. We will learn how to use the inputs and outputs.

There are essentially two types of pins, analog and digital pins. Digital pins can be set to either HIGH (usually 5V or 3.3V) or LOW (0V). You can use that to e.g. read a button state or toggle an LED.

***Important: unfortunately, the MicroPython implementation does not match the regular pinout of your board. This means, that if you want to use for example, digital pin (5), it might be digital pin (27) on one board, or digital pin (14) on another. Please visit the [Board API article](/micropython/basics/board-examples) to see what the pin map for your board is.***

## Digital Pins

Digital signals have two distinct values: HIGH (1) or LOW (0). You use digital signals in situations where the input or output will have one of those two values. For example, you can use a digital signal to turn an LED on or off. 

### Digital Write

In this section we will introduce the `machine` module to control the state of a pin. In this example, we will name the pin `myLED`.

In MicroPython we can declare a `Pin` with two arguments: Pin number, such as `25`, which defines the number of the pin that you would like to control, and `Pin.OUT`, to declare a pin as output. 

Finally, to turn the pin to a high or low state, we set the `value` to either `1` or `0`.

```python
from machine import Pin #import pin function 

myLED = Pin(25, Pin.OUT) #declare pin 25 as an output

myLED.value(1) #set pin to a high state (1) / ON
myLED.value(0) #set pin to a low state (0) / OFF
```

To create the classic "blink" example, we can also import the `time` module, and create a `while` loop.

The following example blinks the onboard LED every second.

```python
from machine import Pin
import time

myLED = Pin(25, Pin.OUT) #Nano RP2040 Connect
#myLED = Pin(10, Pin.OUT) #Nano 33 BLE / Nano 33 BLE Sense
#myLED = Pin(2, Pin.OUT) #Portenta H7


while True:
    myLED.value(0)
    time.sleep(1)  
    myLED.value(1)
    time.sleep(1)
```

### Digital Read (Pull Up)

In this example we read a digital value from a digital pin, using the `PULL_UP` mode. Here, we declare the pin an input through the `Pin.IN` command.

Then, we use `p2.value()` to read the state, which returns either 0 (low) or 1 (high).

```python
from machine import Pin
import utime

p2 = Pin(25, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

while True:
    print(p2.value())
    utime.sleep(1)
```

### Digital Read (Pull Down)

In this example we read a digital value from a digital pin, using the `PULL_DOWN` mode. Here, we declare the pin an input through the `Pin.IN` command.

Then, we use `p2.value()` to read the state, which returns either 0 (low) or 1 (high).

```python
from machine import Pin
import utime

p2 = Pin(25, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN)

while True:
    print(p2.value())
    utime.sleep(1)
```

## Analog Pins

An example of the analog pin is the ADC class, which supplies an interface to analog-to-digital converters, and figures a single endpoint that can sample a continuous voltage and convert it to a discretized value.

There are four methods to use inside the ADC class: `ADC.init`, `ADC.block()`, `ADC.read_16()` and `ADC.read_uv()`.

### Analog Read

To read an analog pin, we can use the `ADC.read_u16` command. This reads the specified analog pin and returns an integer in the range 0 - 65535. For this, we need to import `ADC` and `Pin` from the `machine` module.

```python
import machine
import time

# Make sure to follow the GPIO map for the board you are using.
# Pin 29 in this case is the "A3" pin on the Nano 33 BLE / BLE Sense
adc_pin = machine.Pin(29) 
adc = machine.ADC(adc_pin)

while True:
    reading = adc.read_u16()     
    print("ADC: ",reading)
    time.sleep_ms(500)
```

***If you are using an [Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-rp2040-connect), you can also do the following: `adc = ADC("A4")`. For more information check out the example [here](http://docs.arduino.cc/micropython/basics/board-examples/#analog-read).***

## PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

[PWM](/learn/microcontrollers/analog-output) is used to produce analog results with digital means, by switching ON/OFF a signal rapidly.

As a result, you can simulate a specific voltage written to a pin. In the example below, we write `30000` in a range between 0 - 65535 (16 bits), which if you connect an LED to the pin, will be on at about "half" capacity.

For this, we need to import `PWM` and `Pin` from the `machine` module.

### Coding with PWM

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM, ADC

pwm = PWM(Pin(15))
duty = 30000 #between 0-65000

pwm.freq(1000)

while True:
    pwm.duty_u16(duty)
```
In this example:

- `Pin(15)` is attached to PWM
- `duty` is set at 3000
- `freq` is set at 1 Hz

### PWM on the GIGA R1

On STM32 boards like the [Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi](https://store.arduino.cc/products/giga-r1-wifi), PWM is handled differently. You need to use the `Timer` class along with the `Pin` class from the `pyb` module.

Here's the correct code that works on these boards:

```python
from pyb import Pin, Timer

p = Pin('A13')  # Replace 'A13' with your desired PWM-capable pin
tim = Timer(2, freq=1000)
ch = tim.channel(1, Timer.PWM, pin=p)
ch.pulse_width_percent(25)
```

In this example:

- `p` is a `Pin` object initialized on pin `'A13'`. This pin is set up for PWM output.
- `tim` is a `Timer` object initialized with timer number 2 and a frequency of 1000 Hz.
- `ch` is a PWM channel created on timer 2, channel 1, and is associated with pin `p`.
- `ch.pulse_width_percent(25)` sets the duty cycle of the PWM signal to 25%.
- `'A13'` is marked as **DAC1** on the GIGA R1 WiFi



- Pin names and timer configurations, may vary between different STM32 boards. For more information, check out the [GIGA R1 MicroPython Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/giga-r1-wifi/giga-micropython/).
