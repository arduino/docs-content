---
***Please complete the basic installation-chapters before starting a project.***

This project will show you how to interact with a screen using a button. The script will follow a sequence when the button is pressed and change what is displayed. It will call different functions depending on the current function that is displayed.

## Required Hardware

You will need the following to build this project:

- [Nano ESP32](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nano-esp32)
- [Nano Screw Terminal Adapter](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nano-screw-terminal)
- [OLED Display 0.96"](https://store.arduino.cc/products/grove-oled-display-0-96)
- [Button](https://store.arduino.cc/products/grove-button-p)
- [Grove to male cables](https://store.arduino.cc/products/grove-4-pin-male-to-grove-4-pin-cable-5-pcs)

## Circuit

Assemble the components according to the circuit diagram below:

## Code

Read the comments in the code and change the variables as necessary then upload it to your board.

In order to use the OLED screen you will need to install the following module:

```python
mip.install("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micropython/micropython-lib/master/micropython/drivers/display/ssd1306/ssd1306.py")
```

***If you are unsure how to install external modules you can read up on it [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/micropython/micropython-course/course/examples/#module-installation)***
