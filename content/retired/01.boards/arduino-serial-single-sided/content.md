## Single Sided Board

For those that are in a hurry to produce a board or that don't have an easy access to the postal system (the way how we distribute the boards), it is possible to etch the circuit yourself using the following design.

We have made it fully pin-compatible with the existing boards, this will allow to use the very same shields as the rest of the Arduino family.

On the other hand, you should notice that it is very hard to make the circuit strictly single sided if the pinout is to be respected.

In order to make your own Arduino single sided, you can either download the [CAD](http://webzone.k3.mah.se/k3dacu/arduino/releases/release%5Farduino%5Frs232s%5Fv1%5Fsinglesided.zip) files or a ready-to-use [PDF](http://webzone.k3.mah.se/k3dacu/arduino/releases/serial%5Fv2%5Fsingle%5Fsided/board%5FtoProduce.pdf) that you could just print and etch on a cupper plate. The [partlist](http://arduino.berlios.de/index.php/Main/PartsSerialV2) to this board is fully equivalent to the v2.0 of the serial board.
