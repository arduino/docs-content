The **LilyPad Arduino Main Board** is based on the ATmega168V (the low-power version of the ATmega168) or the ATmega328V. The LilyPad Arduino was designed and developed by Leah Buechley and SparkFun Electronics.

You can find your board warranty information [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/warranty).

### Getting Started

In the [Getting Started section](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoLilyPad), you can find all the information you need to configure your board, use the [Arduino Software (IDE)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), and start to tinker with coding and electronics. SparkFun Electronics has a [range of accessories](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/categories.php?c=135) for use with the LilyPad Arduino.
