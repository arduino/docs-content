![The Arduino Materia 101 assembled](./assets/3dp0002_iso.jpg)

**Arduino Materia 101** is the first official Arduino 3D printer. It uses an Arduino Mega2560 with a shield specifically made for controlling 3D printers. It's a small machine, with a sheet metal design housing the moving parts. The design is straightforward and easy to understand, which makes it a good machine for beginners, or up-and-coming hardware hackers who want to improve and experiment.
Arduino Materia 101 is an open-source machine, from the design of the mechanics to the electronics and firmware, as all Arduino products. It is fully compatible with other open-source design tools such as: Slic3r, OpenSCAD, blender with many many more.

This product comes fully assembled.

As part of the Arduino family, also Materia 101 shares an OpenSource heart. Check the following links in order to access to the great database of information we have available for you.

## Documentation

### Use Manual

How does a 3D Printing machine works? With this simple manual you will be able to print your first project from scratch. Available in two languages, [Italiano](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/UseMateria101_IT.pdf) and [English](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/Materia101_User_Manual_EN_rev4.pdf).

### Assembly Manual

Have you ever assembled a 3D printing machine? It may be quite frustrating at the very beginning of your career as Maker. Here a simple guide to start with, both available in [Italiano](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/Materia_101_Manuale_Assemblaggio_rev2B_smaller.pdf) and [English](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/Materia101_Assembly_Manual_EN_rev4.pdf).

### Firmware

[Download here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/Materia101Firmware.zip) your Materia 101 firmware or check the latest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/radandre/MATERIA101).

### Software

We suggest you to start using [Slic3r](http://slic3r.org/) but there are so many online. Find the one that perfectly fits for you.
