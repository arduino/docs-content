**This is a retired product** 

The [Arduino Pro](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-pro) is intended for advanced users who require flexibility and low-cost. It comes with the minimum of components (no on-board USB or pin headers) to keep the cost down. It's a good choice for a board you want to leave embedded in a project. Please note that there are multiple variants of the board which operate at different voltages and clock speeds. You need to know if you have the 3.3V / 8 MHz version or the 5V / 16 MHz version.

The Arduino Pro is programmed using the [Arduino Software (IDE)](https://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), our Integrated Development Environment common to all our boards and running both [online](https://create.arduino.cc/editor) and offline. For more information on how to get started with the Arduino Software visit the [Getting Started page](https://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).

### Use your Arduino Pro on the Arduino Web IDE



All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the [Arduino Cloud Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor), you only need to install Arduino Create Agent to get started.

The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow this [simple guide](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Arduino_Genuino/getting-started-with-arduino-web-editor-4b3e4a) to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.





### Use your Arduino Pro on the Arduino Desktop IDE

If you want to program your Arduino Pro while offline you need to install the [Arduino Desktop IDE](https://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

The board comes without built-in USB circuitry, so an off-board USB-to-TTL serial converter must be used to upload sketches. For the 3.3V Arduino Pro boards, this can be a [FTDI TTL-232R-3V3 USB - TTL Level Serial Converter Cable](https://ftdichip.com/products/ttl-232r-3v3/) or the SparkFun[FTDI Basic Breakout Board (3.3V)](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8772). For the 5V Arduino Pro boards, use a [TTL-232R USB - TTL Level Serial Converter](https://ftdichip.com/products/ttl-232r-5v/) or the SparkFun[FTDI Basic Breakout Board (5V)](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9115). (You can probably also get away with using a 5V USB-to-serial converter with a 3.3V board and vice-versa, but it's not recommended.)

If using the FTDI cable on Windows, you'll need to make one configuration change to enable the auto-reset. With the board connected, open the Device Manager (in Control Panels > System > Hardware), and find the USB Serial Port under Ports. Right-click and select properties, then go to Port Settings > Advanced and check Set RTS on Close under Miscellaneous Options.

#### Open your first sketch

Open the LED blink example sketch: **File > Examples >01.Basics > Blink**.

#### Select your board type and port

For the 3.3V versions of the Arduino Pro, select **Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (3.3V, 8 MHz) w/ ATmega328P** or **Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (3.3V, 8 MHz) w/ ATmega168** from the **Tools > Board** menu (depending on the microcontroller on your board). For the 5V versions of the Arduino Pro, select **Arduino Duemilanove or Nano w/ ATmega328P** or **Arduino Diecimila, Duemilanove, or Nano w/ ATmega168**.

The external USB-to-TTL serial converter will power the Arduino Pro, regardless of the position of the switch.

#### Upload and Run your first Sketch

To upload the sketch to the Arduino Pro, you need to press the upload button in the Arduino environment.

Click the **Upload** button in the upper left to load and run the sketch on your board:

Wait a few seconds - you should see the RX and TX leds on the board flashing. If the upload is successful, the message "Done uploading." will appear in the status bar.

#### Learn more on the Desktop IDE

[See this tutorial](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Arduino_Genuino/getting-started-with-the-arduino-software-ide-623be4) for a generic guide on the Arduino IDE with a few more infos on the Preferences, the Board Manager, and the Library Manager.

### Tutorials

Now that you have set up and programmed your Arduino Pro board, you may find inspiration in our [Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub) tutorial platform.

### Please Read...

#### Standalone usage

To use the board standalone, with no connection to a computer, it can be be powered by a battery or an external power supply (wall wart). You can solder the + and - wires of a battery connector to the corresponding holes on the board. For the 3.3V boards, you can connect a LiPo battery (with JST connector) to the JST jack. Alternatively, solder a DC power jack into the three large holes on the board, and connect a DC power supply (center positive). When the switch is in the "Batt" position, the board will draw power from an attached battery; when it is in the "Ext." position, power comes from an external power supply. In either position, the board can be powered by the 6-pin USB header.

#### Connectors

Any standard 0.1" spaced header can be soldered to the holes on the Arduino Pro. To use every pin requires two 6-pin header and two 8-pin headers. Bare wire can also be soldered directly to the holes. Note that the header spacing is compatible with Arduino shields.
