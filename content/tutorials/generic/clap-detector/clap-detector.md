## Introduction
This example reads audio data from an Invensense's ICS43432I2S microphone breakout board, and uses the input to detect clapping sounds. The built-in LED is toggled when a clap is detected.

## Goals

- How to use and read audio data.
- How to use audio as an input.

## Hardware & Software Needed

- [Arduino Zero](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-zero), [MKRZero](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr-zero-i2s-bus-sd-for-sound-music-digital-audio-data?queryID=undefined)  or [MKR1000 WiFi](/hardware/mkr-1000-wifi) Board

- Invensense's ICS43432I2S microphone
- Arduino IDE ([online](https://create.arduino.cc/) or [offline](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)).
- [ArduinoSound Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoSound)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

### Circuit

## Programming the Board


**1.** First, let's make sure we have correct the drivers installed. If we are using the Cloud Editor, we do not need to install anything. If we are using an offline editor, we need to install it manually. This can be done by navigating to **Tools > Board > Board Manager...**. Here we need to look for the **Arduino SAMD boards (32-bits Arm® Cortex®-M0+)** and install it. 

**2.** Now, we need to install the libraries needed. If we are using the Cloud Editor, there is no need to install anything. If we are using an offline editor, simply go to **Tools > Manage libraries...** and search for **ArduinoSound** and install it.


The sketch can be found in the snippet below. Upload the sketch to the board.

## Testing It Out

After you have uploaded the code, start clapping. The in-built LED should now light up!

### Troubleshoot

If the code is not working, there are some common issues we can troubleshoot:

- The microphone is not wired correctly.
- Make sure there are no missing curly brackets {}.
- You have not installed the [ArduinoSound Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoSound).
- You have not selected the right port and board.

## Conclusion

In this example, we have learned how to create a clap detector using the [ArduinoSound Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoSound) with a microphone to turn on the in-built LED. With this knowledge in the bag you can start to think about how sound can be used as an input to control various outputs!
