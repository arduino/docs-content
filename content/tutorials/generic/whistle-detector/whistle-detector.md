## Introduction
This example reads audio data from an Invensense's ICS43432I2S microphone breakout board, and uses the input to detect whistling sounds at a particular frequency. When a whistle is detected, it's level is used to control the  brightness of the built-in LED.

## Goals

- How to use and read audio data.
- How to use audio as an input to control the brightness of an LED.

## Hardware & Software Needed

- [Arduino Zero](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-zero), [MKRZero](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkr-zero-i2s-bus-sd-for-sound-music-digital-audio-data?queryID=undefined)  or [MKR1000](/hardware/mkr-1000-wifi) Board

- Invensense's ICS43432I2S microphone
- Arduino IDE ([online](https://create.arduino.cc/) or [offline](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)).
- [ArduinoSound Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoSound)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Programming the Board



**1.** First, let's make sure we have correct the drivers installed. If we are using the Cloud Editor, we do not need to install anything. If we are using an offline editor, we need to install it manually. This can be done by navigating to **Tools > Board > Board Manager...**. Here we need to look for the **Arduino SAMD boards (32-bits Arm® Cortex®-M0+)** and install it. 

**2.** Now, we need to install the libraries needed. If we are using the Cloud Editor, there is no need to install anything. If we are using an offline editor, simply go to **Tools > Manage libraries...** and search for **ArduinoSound** and install it.


The sketch can be found in the snippet below. Upload the sketch to the board.

## Testing It Out

After you have uploaded the code, start whisling. You should now be able to control the brightness of the in-built LED depending on the level of the whistle.

### Troubleshoot

If the code is not working, there are some common issues we can troubleshoot:

- The microphone is not wired correctly.
- You have not uploaded the sketch to the board.
- You have not installed the correct drivers.
- You have not installed the [ArduinoSound Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoSound).

## Conclusion

In this example, we have learned how to use whistling to control the brightness of the in-built LED, using the [ArduinoSound Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoSound) and a microphone. Now that you have learned how to use whistling as an input, you can start thinking about how to apply this input for other projects!
