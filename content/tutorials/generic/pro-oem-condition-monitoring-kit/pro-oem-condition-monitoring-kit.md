The Pro Smart Industry OEM Condition Monitoring Kit is the perfect way to learn and create solutions focused on a micro PLC programming environment, industrial instrumentation and control applications.

- Develop experience in programming a micro PLC with IEC 61131-3 languages or Arduino C++ to realize a small industrial control system.
- Implement projects including temperature measurements exploiting the Portenta Machine Control’s capabilities with 3 temperature inputs for Thermocouples J/K and RTD PT100.
- Experience multiple communication features (Ethernet and Wi-Fi®) and get familiar with Fieldbus communications (Modbus RTU through RS485 and Modbus TCP through Ethernet)

## Getting Started with Your Kit

1. Get to [cloud.arduino.cc](https://cloud.arduino.cc/), sign in, or Create an Arduino account. Rescue your Arduino Cloud 3 months voucher code using this [Procedure](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/generic/cloud-business-voucher-redeem) and [Get Started](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/arduino-cloud-for-business)!

2. Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#future-version-of-the-arduino-ide) and follow the [Installation Procedure](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing) and [Get Started with it](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started-ide-v2).

3. Download [Arduino PLC IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#arduino-plc-ide) and follow the [Installation Procedure](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/plc-ide/tutorials/plc-ide-setup-license) and [Get Started with it](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/plc-ide/tutorials/plc-programming-introduction). Use the PLC KEY code supplied in the bundle to unlock for lifetime the Portenta Machine Control to be programmed with PLC IDE.

4. Check the [Portenta Machine Control docs](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/portenta-machine-control) to retrieve the product resources. Carefully read the [datasheet](https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/datasheets/AKX00032-datasheet.pdf). On [docs.arduino.cc](http://docs.arduino.cc) the [Pinout](https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/pinouts/AKX00032-full-pinout.pdf) and [Schematics](https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/schematics/AKX00032-schematics.pdf) are also available.

5. Start practicing the first examples included in the User Manual, deep dive into the knowledge topics needed to exploit all the product’s features such as [Modbus Protocol](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/communication/modbus), and try the programs available in the [Portenta Machine Control Library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_MachineControl/tree/master/examples), the IDE examples, and the experiences proposed below.
