The Pro Industrial Automation and Lighting Kit is the perfect way to learn and create solutions focused on a micro PLC programming environment, industrial communication protocols and control applications.

- Develop experience in programming a micro PLC with IEC 61131-3 languages or Arduino C++ to realize a small industrial control system.
- Experience multiple communication features (Ethernet and WiFi) and get familiar with Fieldbus communications (Modbus RTU through RS485 and Modbus TCP through Ethernet).

## Getting Started with Your Kit

1. Get to [cloud.arduino.cc](https://cloud.arduino.cc/), sign in or Create an Arduino account. Rescue your Arduino Cloud 3 months voucher code using this [Procedure](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/generic/cloud-business-voucher-redeem) and [Get Started](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/arduino-cloud-for-business!)

2. Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#future-version-of-the-arduino-ide) and follow the [Installation Procedure](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing) and [Get Started with it](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started-ide-v2)

3. Download [Arduino PLC IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#arduino-plc-ide) and follow the [Installation Procedure](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/plc-ide/tutorials/plc-ide-setup-license) and [Get Started with it](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/plc-ide/tutorials/plc-programming-introduction)

4. Check the [Opta docs](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/opta) to retrieve the product resources. Carefully read the [datasheet](https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/datasheets/AFX00001-AFX00002-AFX00003-datasheet.pdf) and the [User Manual](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/opta/user-manual). On [docs.arduino.cc](http://docs.arduino.cc) is also available the [Pinout](https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/pinouts/opta-full-pinout.pdf).

5. Start practicing the first examples included in the user manual, the IDE examples, and deep dive into the knowledge topics needed to exploit all the product’s features such as [Modbus Protocol](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/communication/modbus) and the experiences proposed below.


## Experiences Proposed

If you want to learn more about the technologies of the kit, we propose the following experiences:
