## Software Requirements

- An [Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/) account is required to proceed with the steps provided in the following section. If you do not have an account, you can create one for free inside [cloud.arduino.cc](https://cloud.arduino.cc/home/?get-started=true).

## Arduino Cloud for Business Voucher

The __Arduino Cloud for Business Voucher__ grants the holder a one-time redemption opportunity for a trial-period subscription plan to the Arduino Cloud for Business.

## Voucher Activation Code

This voucher grants access to a single trial-period subscription plan to the Arduino Cloud for Business through a unique alphanumerical code. For simplicity, in this tutorial, we will refer to a sample code formed as:
