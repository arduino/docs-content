## Software Requirements

- An [Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/) account is required to proceed with the steps provided in the following section. If you do not have an account, you can create one for free inside [cloud.arduino.cc](https://cloud.arduino.cc/home/?get-started=true).

## Arduino Cloud for Business Voucher

The __Arduino Cloud for Business Voucher__ grants the holder a one-time redemption opportunity for a trial-period subscription plan to the Arduino Cloud for Business.

## Voucher Activation Code

This voucher grants access to a single trial-period subscription plan to the Arduino Cloud for Business through a unique alphanumerical code. For simplicity, in this tutorial, we will refer to a sample code formed as:

`XXXXXXXXXX`

Any alphanumerical character received in the redemption code must be copied and used (including special characters like dash "-").

Once you have your unique code, follow the process below to redeem it and fully leverage the extensive benefits offered.

## Voucher Redemption Process

Navigate to the [Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/) page and log in with your account using the `SIGN IN` button in the top-right corner. If you do not have an account, you can create one for free at [cloud.arduino.cc](https://cloud.arduino.cc/home/?get-started=true).

The `Billing Information` page requires you to enter basic details before entering payment information. Payment information entry is an optional step: if you don't fill in the payment information at the voucher's expiry date, your Cloud for Business account will expire. If you want to keep it, You must access the payment information section and fill it in.

You will be asked to provide:

- Billing Type
- Billing Address

If you have previously registered billing information, you can update it if any changes have occurred. Once these details are confirmed, proceed to the `Payment` page, where you will optionally enter payment information and have the opportunity to apply your voucher code.
