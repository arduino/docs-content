The Pro Smart Agriculture and Irrigation Kit is the perfect way to learn and create solutions focused on Smart Farming developments, low-energy wireless technologies, and remote monitoring with the Cloud.

- Connect sensors and drive actuators to automate your irrigation processes.
- Easily implement precision farming, monitoring real-time weather conditions, soil quality, crop’s growth, among other parameters and use Arduino Cloud to generate valuable analytics to support business processes at various levels, including plant growth, equipment efficiency, staff performance, and much more.
- Connect your devices through WisGate Edge Lite, to add LoRa® connectivity layer and extend the possibility of connecting it in open field.

## Getting Started with Your Kit

1. Get to [cloud.arduino.cc](https://cloud.arduino.cc/), sign in, or Create an Arduino account. Rescue your Arduino IoT Cloud 3 months voucher code using this [Procedure](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/generic/cloud-business-voucher-redeem) and [Get Started](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/arduino-cloud-for-business!)

2. Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#future-version-of-the-arduino-ide) and follow the [Installation Procedure](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing) and [Get Started with it](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started-ide-v2)

3. Check the [Edge Control docs](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/edge-control) and [Enclosure kit](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/enclosure-kit) to retrieve the product resources. Carefully read the [datasheet](https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/datasheets/AKX00034-rev-1-datasheet.pdf), and [get started](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/edge-control/getting-started-edge-control) with the product and learn how to [assemble the enclosure](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/enclosure-kit/assembly-instructions). On [docs.arduino.cc](http://docs.arduino.cc) are also available the [Pinout](https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/pinouts/AKX00034-full-pinout.pdf) and [Schematics](https://docs.arduino.cc/resources/schematics/AKX00044-schematics.pdf)

4. Check the [MKR WAN 1310 docs](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/mkr-wan-1310) and [MKR WiFi 1010](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/mkr-wifi-1010) for more info on the boards used with Edge Control.

5. Check the [WisGate Edge Lite 2 docs](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/wisgate-edge-lite-2), carefully read the [datasheet](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7268/Datasheet/), and [get started](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/wisgate-edge-lite-2/getting-started) with the product.
