<FeatureDescription>

Designed to facilitate motor control, the Nano Motor Carrier takes care of the electronics required to control the motors, allowing students to focus on prototyping and building their projects. It can also be used to connect other actuators and sensors via a series of 3-pin male headers. The board features an on board 9 axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. It includes a battery charger for single cell Li-ion batteries and it contains 2 ports for quadrature encoder counting.
