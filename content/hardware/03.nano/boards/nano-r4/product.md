The **Arduino Nano R4** brings the power of a 32-bit **Arm® Cortex®-M4** processor to the beloved Nano family board form factor. Based on the **Renesas RA4M1** microcontroller, it features **256 kB Flash**, **32 kB SRAM** and an **8 kB EEPROM**, all running at **48 MHz** with a built-in **real-time clock** (RTC), **14-bit ADC** and a **12-bit DAC**.

With a **USB-C® connector**, support for **CAN bus**, and +5 VDC and +3.3 VDC I2C connectivity (thanks to the onboard Qwiic connector), the Nano R4 is ideal for modern embedded applications, edge computing and seamless integration with the Arduino Modulino ecosystem.

Perfect for both beginners and advanced users, the Nano R4 is fully compatible with the **Arduino IDE** and **Arduino Cloud** to accelerate development and deployment.
