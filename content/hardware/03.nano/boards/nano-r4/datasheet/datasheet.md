## Features
### General Specifications Overview

The Nano R4 is an evolution of its predecessor, the Nano Classic, which was previously based on 8-bit AVR microcontrollers. There are thousands of guides, tutorials and books written about the Nano board, where Nano R4 continues its legacy.

The board features the standard 14x digital I/O ports, 6x analog channels, dedicated pins for I2C, SPI and UART
connections. Compared to its predecessors the board has a much larger memory: 8x times more flash memory (256 kB) and 16x times more SRAM (32 kB).

### USB-C® Connector

The Nano R4 has one USB-C® port, used to power and program your board as well as send and receive serial communication.

<div style="background-color: #FFFFE0; border-left: 6px solid #FFD700; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
You should not power the board with more than <strong>5 V</strong> via the USB-C® port.
</div>

### Digital Analog Converter (DAC)

The Nano R4 has a DAC with up to 12-bit resolution attached to the A0 analog pin. A DAC is used to convert a digital signal to an analog signal.

### Operational Amplifier (OPAMP)

The Nano R4 features one Operational Amplifier accesible through the board analog pins. See the [pinout](#pinout) section for details.

| Parameter               | Conitions       | Min | Typ | Max     | Unit |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | --- | --- | ------- | ---- |
| Common mode input range | Low power mode  | 0.2 | -   | VCC-0.5 | V    |
| Common mode input range | High-speed mode | 0.3 | -   | VCC-0.6 | V    |
| Output voltage range    | Low power mode  | 0.1 | -   | VCC-0.1 | V    |
| Output voltage range    | High-speed mode | 0.1 | -   | VCC-0.1 | V    |

### Qwiic I2C Connector

The I2C Qwiic connector SM04B-SRSS-TB(LF)(SN) is connected to a secondary I2C bus on the board. This connector is powered via 3.3 V following the Qwiic standard system and makes the Nano R4 compatible with the Arduino Modulino nodes.

![Arduino Nano R4 Qwiic Connector](assets/Nano_R4-Qwiic-connector.png)

The standard I2C is accessible through the Nano breakout pins A4 for SDA and A5 for SCL as its predecessors.

<div style="background-color: #FFFFE0; border-left: 6px solid #FFD700; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
A4 and A5 are connected to the main I2C bus, these pins should not be used as ADC inputs whenever the bus is in use. You can however connect I2C devices to each of these pins and connectors simultaneously.
</div>

### Realtime Clock (RTC)

The Nano R4 features a Real-time Clock allowing you to keep accurate time (date and clock), even when the board is powered off. This is ideal for data logging, scheduling tasks, or timestamping events.

The Realtime Clock (RTC) has two counting modes: calendar count mode and binary count mode, both are controlled by the register settings.

- For calendar count mode, the RTC has a 100-year calendar from 2000 to 2099 and automatically adjusts dates for leap years.
- For binary count mode, the RTC counts seconds and retains the information as a serial value. Binary count mode can be used for calendars other than the Gregorian (Western) calendar.

## Power and Ratings
### Recommended Operating Conditions

| Symbol          | Description                      | Min | Typ | Max  | Unit |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| V<sub>IN</sub>  | Input voltage from VIN pad       | 6.0 | 7.0 | 21.0 | V    |
| V<sub>USB</sub> | Input voltage from USB connector | 4.8 | 5.0 | 5.5  | V    |
| T<sub>OP</sub>  | Operating Temperature            | -40 | 25  | 85   | °C   |

**Note:** V<sub>DD</sub> controls the logic level and is connected to the 5 V power rail. V<sub>AREF</sub> set the reference for the analog logic.

### Power Options

Power can either be supplied via the VIN pin, or via USB-C® connector. If power is supplied via VIN, the MP2322GQH buck converter steps the voltage down to 5 V.
The 5 V output of the buck converter is connected to a Schottky diode in place for reverse polarity & overvoltage protection respectively.

#### Power Tree

The following diagram illustrates the Nano R4 main system power architecture.

![Arduino Nano R4 Power Tree](assets/Nano_R4_Power_Tree.png)

### Battery Backup

The Nano R4 features a battery backup function. It can be powered through the **VBATT** pin (see [pinout](#pinout) section).
The battery backup will power the RTC, the 32.768 kHz oscillators, the wakeup control and the backup memory.

During normal operation, the battery powered area is powered by the main power supply, which is the VCC pin. When a VCC voltage drop is detected, the power source is switched to
the dedicated battery backup power pin, the VBATT pin. When the voltage rises again, the power source is switched from the VBATT pin to the VCC pin.

| Parameter                                               | Min  | Typ  | Max  | Unit |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| VBATT power supply voltage                              | 1.6  | -    | 3.6  | V    |
| Voltage level for switching to battery backup (falling) | 1.99 | 2.09 | 2.19 | V    |

### GPIO Voltage

The Nano R4 operates at 5 V as do all pins on this board except for the **Qwiic** connector that works at **3.3 V**. This connector draws power from the AP2112K-3.3TRG1 regulator.

### GPIO Current

The GPIOs on the R7FA4M1AB3CFM#HA0 microcontroller can handle up to **8 mA**. Never connect devices that draw higher current directly to a GPIO.

In case you need to power external devices that require more power, e.g. servo motors, use an external power supply.

To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.

### Conflict Minerals Declaration

As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regards to laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder, or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas.
