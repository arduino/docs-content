Here you will find the technical specifications for the Arduino® Nano R4.

**Please read: operating voltage**

The **Nano R4** microcontroller operates at +5 VDC, making it fully compatible with traditional Arduino shields, modules, and accessories designed for +5 VDC logic levels. This allows seamless reuse of existing components and simplifies interfacing with various +5 VDC sensors and actuators.

Unlike boards based on +3.3 VDC logic (such as the Nano ESP32), the Nano R4 does not require logic level shifting when connecting to most classic Arduino components.

The board supports multiple power input options:

The VIN pin accepts an input voltage range of +6–21 VDC, which is internally regulated down to +5 VDC.

The board can also be powered directly via the board's USB-C® port, which supplies +5 VDC to the system.

All GPIO pins operate at +5 VDC and can source or sink up to 8 mA of current per pin.

Always verify the voltage requirements of any connected peripheral to the board and avoid drawing more current than the board’s limits to prevent instability or permanent damage.
