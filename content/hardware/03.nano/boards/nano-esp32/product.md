The Arduino Nano ESP32 is the first ever Arduino board based on a ESP32 microcontroller from [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32), the **NORA-W106 module** from u-blox®. USB-C® connector, 16 MB (128 Mbit) of Flash, support for MicroPython & Arduino Cloud enabled, it is a very versatile development board.

This board is a perfect entry point to learn MicroPython, dive into it with our free course: [MicroPython 101](/micropython-course)
