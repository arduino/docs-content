## Introduction

ESP-NOW is a wireless communication protocol developed by Espressif, the company behind the ESP32 microcontroller (MCU). Since the Arduino Nano ESP32 is equipped with that MCU it also supports the ESP-NOW protocol out of the box. It's designed for efficient and low-latency communication between devices, capable of sending up to 250 bytes.

***Note: The Nano ESP32 utilizes the Arduino ESP32 Boards core based on the 2.x branch of the arduino-esp32 core, leveraging ESP-IDF version [v5.1.4](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.1.4/esp32/api-reference/network/esp_now.html). Please be aware that functions and features may differ between versions, so ensure you reference the correct documentation for this setup.***

## Hardware Requirements

ESP-NOW is supported on the following microcontrollers: 

- [Arduino Nano ESP32](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nano-esp32)
- generic ESP8266
- generic ESP32
- generic ESP32-S 
- ESP32-C series of SoCs

You need two boards or more to communicate via ESP-NOW. Minimum one sender and one receiver.

## How It Works

### Communication Protocol 
ESP-NOW operates as a peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol, meaning it allows direct communication between two ESP8266 or ESP32 devices without the need for a central server or access point, e.g. a Wi-Fi® router. Each ESP device has a unique [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) which is used to identify the receiving board.

ESP-NOW can be set up in different ways:

**One-way communication**: In one-way communication mode, one device (the sender) can send data to another device (the receiver) without expecting a response. This mode is often used for scenarios where one device provides data or commands to another device, such as remote sensor readings or control commands.

**Two-way communication**: In two-way communication mode, both devices can exchange data bidirectionally. This mode enables a back-and-forth exchange of information between the devices, allowing for more interactive and responsive communication. It's suitable for applications where devices need to send and receive data from each other, such as remote control systems or interactive IoT devices.

### Protocol Stack

ESP-NOW operates primarily at the data-link layer of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). In contrast to traditional networking protocols that involve multiple layers, ESP-NOW condenses the communication stack, streamlining the process. By reducing the protocol stack to a single layer, ESP-NOW eliminates the need for complex [packet headers](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) and unpackers on each layer. This simplicity results in quicker response times, reducing delays caused by packet loss in congested networks.

### Lightweight Design
The protocol minimizes communication overhead, making it more efficient for resource-constrained devices. It also doesn’t perform [handshakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshake_(computing)) as devices are preconfigured to allow for faster data transmission and reduced power consumption.

### Limited Data Quantities 
ESP-NOW is useful when transmitting smaller amounts of data (max 250 bytes). It utilizes action frames for communication. Action frames are specialized data frames that contain information about the action being performed. These frames allow ESP-NOW devices to efficiently exchange data without the overhead associated with more generic data frames.

### Low Latency
As a result of the limited data quantities and its lightweight design ESP-NOW introduces a low latency, which means that devices can quickly exchange data making it suitable for remote controlling other devices, e.g. a radio car.

## Limitations

### Limited Range 
ESP-NOW has a limited signal range, typically around 220 meters under ideal conditions. The actual range can vary depending on factors like environmental interference, antenna design, and obstacles in the communication path.

### Interference 
Like other wireless communication technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band, ESP-NOW can be susceptible to interference from other devices and Wi-Fi networks. It's essential to choose communication channels carefully to minimize interference and ensure reliable communication.

### No Network Infrastructure
ESP-NOW is designed for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication but doesn't provide the infrastructure for building complex network topologies. If your application requires a network with multiple interconnected devices or Internet connectivity, you may need to complement ESP-NOW with additional networking solutions.

### Limited Data Payload 
ESP-NOW is optimized for transmitting smaller amounts of data, with a maximum payload of around 250 bytes. If your application requires high-bandwidth data transfer or large file exchanges, other services such as the [Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/) might be more suitable.

### Security Considerations
While ESP-NOW offers some level of data privacy, it may not be as secure as other communication protocols like HTTPS or MQTT with robust encryption. If your project involves sensitive data, consider implementing additional security measures to protect against eavesdropping and unauthorized access.

### No Message Acknowledgment
ESP-NOW does not provide built-in acknowledgment mechanisms for confirming successful message delivery. If message reliability is crucial for your application, you'll need to implement your own acknowledgment and error-handling mechanisms.

### Compatibility
ESP-NOW is primarily designed for use with ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers. While it can be compatible with other ESP32-based devices, it may not work seamlessly with other non-ESP platforms. Compatibility should be considered when designing a system with multiple types of devices.

## Arduino Cloud

Arduino provides their own service for handling wireless communication called Arduino Cloud. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/).

While the Arduino Cloud offers similar features to the ESP-NOW protocols they are vastly different and should be used for specific use cases. Check the comparison table below for more information.
