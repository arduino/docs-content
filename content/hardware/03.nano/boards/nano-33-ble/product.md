The Arduino Nano 33 BLE shares its pinout with the classic Arduino Nano but builds on the nRF52840 microcontroller with 1MB CPU Flash Memory. Featuring a 9 axis inertial measurement unit and the possibility for Bluetooth® Low Energy connectivity it can help you to create your next Bluetooth® Low Energy enabled project.
