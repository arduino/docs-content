The Arduino Nano Matter Community Version combines Arduino's user-friendly approach with the powerful MGM240S technology from Silicon Labs. This enables Makers and Professionals to work with **[MatterÂ®](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/)**, the popular standard for IoT devices, taking advantage of the Nano's low-power and compact design.
