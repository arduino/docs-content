**Important Note: Operating Voltage**

This board operates at +3.3 VDC, and applying voltages higher than +3.3 VDC to any I/O pin will permanently damage it. The 5V pin (between RST and A7) is disconnected by default as a safety precaution and requires a solder bridge on the VUSB pads to enable it when powered via USB. For detailed information about voltage compatibility and pin configuration, please refer to the board's user manual.
