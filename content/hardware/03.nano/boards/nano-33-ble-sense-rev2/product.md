The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 integrates powerful edge computing capabilities with extensive environmental sensing in a compact 18 mm x 45 mm form factor. Built on the nRF52840 microcontroller with a 64 MHz Arm® Cortex®-M4F processor, this board combines Bluetooth® Low Energy 5.0 connectivity with a complete sensor suite including a 9-axis IMU, environmental sensors, gesture detection, and a digital microphone. Deploy edge AI models directly on-device for real-time pattern recognition, predictive maintenance, or voice processing without cloud dependency. Available with or without headers for flexible integration into your projects.
