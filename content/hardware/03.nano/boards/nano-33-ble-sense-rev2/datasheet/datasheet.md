## The Board

As all Nano form factor boards, Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 does not have a battery charger but can be powered through USB or headers.

**NOTE:** Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 only supports 3.3V I/Os and is **NOT** 5V tolerant so please make sure you are not directly connecting 5V signals to this board or it will be damaged. Also, as opposed to Arduino Nano boards that support 5V operation, the 5V pin does NOT supply voltage but is rather connected, through a jumper, to the USB power input.

### Processor

The Main Processor is an Arm® Cortex®-M4F running at up to 64MHz. Most of its pins are connected to the external headers, however some are reserved for internal communication with the wireless module and the on-board internal I<sup>2</sup>C peripherals (IMU and Crypto).

**NOTE**: As opposed to other Arduino Nano boards, pins A4 and A5 have an internal pull up and default to be used as an I<sup>2</sup>C Bus so usage as analog inputs is not recommended.

### IMU

The Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 provides IMU capabilities with 9-axis, by combination of the BMI270 and BMM150 ICs. The BMI270 includes both a three axis gyroscope as well as an three axis accelerometer, while the BMM150 is capable of sensing magnetic field variations in all three dimensions. The information obtained can be used for measuring raw movement parameters as well as for machine learning.

### LPS22HB (U9) Barometer and Temperature Sensor

The LPS22HB pressure sensor IC (U9) includes both a piezoresistive absolute pressure sensor together with a temperature sensor integrated into a small chip. The pressure sensor (U9) interfaces with the main microcontroller (U1) via an I2C interface. The sensing element is composed of a micromachined suspended membrane for measuring absolute pressure, and includes a Wheatstone bridge internally for measuring the the piezoresistive elements. The temperature perturbations are compensated via an included temperature sensor on-chip. The absolute pressure can range from 260 to 1260 hPa. Pressure data can be polled via I2C at up to 24-bits, while temperature data can be polled at up to 16-bits.

The Arduino_LPS22HB library provides a ready to use implementation of the I2C protocol with this chip.

### HS3003 (U8) Relative Humidity and Temperature Sensor

The HS3003 (U8) is a MEMS sensors, designed to provide accurate readings of relative humidity and temperature in a small package. Temperature-compensation and calibration is performed on-chip, without requiring external circuitry. The HS3003 can measure the relative humidity from 0% to 100%RH with fast response times (under 4 seconds). The included on-chip temperature sensor (used for compensation) is has a temperature accuracy of ±0.1 °C.

U8 communicates via the main microcontroller via an I2C bus.

#### Gesture Detection

Gesture detection utilizes four directional photodiodes to sense reflected IR energy (sourced by the integrated LED) to convert physical motion information (i.e. velocity, direction and distance) to a digital information. The architecture of the gesture engine features automatic activation (based on Proximity engine results), ambient light subtraction, cross-talk cancellation, dual 8-bit data converters, power saving inter-conversion delay, 32-dataset FIFO, and interrupt driven I2C communication. The gesture engine accommodates a wide range of mobile device gesturing requirements: simple UP-DOWN-RIGHT-LEFT gestures or more complex gestures can be accurately sensed. Power consumption and noise are minimized with adjustable IR LED timing.

#### Proximity Detection

The Proximity detection feature provides distance measurement (E.g. mobile device screen to user’s ear) by photodiode detection of reflected IR energy (sourced by the integrated LED). Detect/release events are interrupt driven, and occur whenever proximity result crosses upper and/ or lower threshold settings. The proximity engine features offset adjustment registers to compensate for system offset caused by unwanted IR energy reflections appearing at the sensor. The IR LED intensity is factory trimmed to eliminate the need for end-equipment calibration due to component variations. Proximity results are further improved by automatic ambient light subtraction.

#### Color and ALS Detection

The Color and ALS detection feature provides red, green, blue and clear light intensity data. Each of the R, G, B, C channels have a UV and IR blocking filter and a dedicated data converter producing16-bit data simultaneously. This architecture allows applications to accurately measure ambient light and sense color which enables devices to calculate color temperature and control display backlight.

### Digital Microphone

The MP34DT06JTR is an ultra-compact, low-power, omnidirectional, digital MEMS microphone built with a capacitive sensing element and an IC interface.

The sensing element, capable of detecting acoustic waves, is manufactured using a specialized silicon micromachining process dedicated to produce audio sensors

### Power Tree

The board can be powered via USB connector, V<sub>IN</sub> or V<sub>USB</sub> pins on headers.

![Power tree](assets/powerTree.svg)

**NOTE:** Since V<sub>USB</sub> feeds V<sub>IN</sub> via a Schottky diode and a DC-DC regulator specified minimum input voltage is 4.5V the minimum supply voltage from USB has to be increased to a voltage in the range between 4.8V to 4.96V depending on the current being drawn.

## Board Operation

### Getting Started - IDE

If you want to program your Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE [1] To connect the Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 to your computer, you’ll need a Micro-B USB cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor

All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Cloud Editor [2], by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow [3] to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud

All Arduino IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud which allows you to Log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Sample Sketches

Sample sketches for the Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino IDE or in the “Documentation” section of the Arduino Docs website.

### Online Resources

Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on Arduino Project Hub [4], the Arduino Library Reference [5] and the on line store where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.

### Board Recovery

All Arduino boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after power up.
