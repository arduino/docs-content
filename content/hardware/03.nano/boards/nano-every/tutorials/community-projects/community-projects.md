This great video from [Elektor](https://www.elektor.com/) shows how to create a NeoPixel driver through the Custom Configurable Logic (CCL) block. It also serves as a nice introduction to the Nano Every board! 

## Turntable For 7" Records

If you happen to be a vintage record collector AND a fan of DIY electronics, this project might interest you. 

Using a Nano Every and a custom PCB, this maker made a turntable capable of playing 7" records (singles), and it is impressive to say the least! Check it out in the link below:

## Smart Electricity Meter

A bit more advanced use case for the Nano Every is documented by user [torstengeppert](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/torstengeppert) on the Arduino Project Hub platform.

This smart electricity meter measures and stores the readings from two meters, simultaneously. To read more about this project, visit the link below:
