# Description 
ArduinoÂ® Nano Every is a miniature sized module containing an ATMega4809 AVR processor and an ATSAMD11D14A ArmÂ® CortexÂ®-M0+ processor to act as a bridge between USB and the main AVR processor. The module can either be mounted as a DIP component (when mounting pin headers), or as a SMT component, directly soldering it via the castellated pads.

## The Board
As all Nano form factor boards, Nano Every does not have a battery charger but can be powered through USB or headers.

**NOTE:** Arduino Nano Every is 5V compatible so it is a drop in replacement for the standard Nano board

### Processor
The Main Processor is an AVR running at up to 20MHz. Most of its pins are connected to the external headers, however some are reserved for internal communication with the USB Bridge coprocessor.

Communication with SAMD11D14A happens through a serial port and a single wire programming through the following pins:

| **ATMega4809 Pin** | **ATMega4809 Acronym** | **SAMD11 Pin** | **SAMD11 Acronym** | **Description**           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 9                           | PB05                           | 15                     | PA22                   | SAMD11 TX ðŸ¡º ATMega4809 RX |

| 41                          | UPDI                           | 12                     | PA15                   | UPDI RX                   |
| 11                          | PA14                           | UPDI TX                |                        |                           |

### USB Bridge
The SAMD11D14A processor is shipped with a firmware that implements USB to serial bridge and handles ATMega4809 firmware upgrade through the UPDI interface.

Firmware also has a bootloader that allows reprogramming to implement other USB classes, expanding the possibilities of classic Nano boards that are limited to serial bridge.

**NOTE:** SAMD11D14A pins are 3.3V only and are connected to ATMega4809 through level shifters. Although it is possible to wire its pins to the external world care must be taken as they are NOT 5V tolerant

### Power Tree
The board can be powered via USB connector, V<sub>IN</sub> or V<sub>USB</sub> pins on headers. 

![Power tree](assets/powerTree.svg)

**NOTE:** Since V<sub>USB</sub> feeds V<sub>IN</sub> via a Schottky diode and a DC-DC regulator specified minimum input voltage is 4.5V the minimum supply voltage from USB has to be increased to a voltage in the range between 4.8V to 4.96V depending on the current being drawn.

## Board Operation
### Getting Started - IDE 
If you want to program your Nano Every while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE [1] To connect the Nano Every to your computer, youâ€™ll need a Micro-B USB cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.



### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor
All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Cloud Editor [2], by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud
All Arduino IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud which allows you to Log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

## Sample Sketches
### Online Resources
Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on Arduino Project Hub **[4]**, the Arduino Library Reference **[5]** and the on line store **[6]** where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.
