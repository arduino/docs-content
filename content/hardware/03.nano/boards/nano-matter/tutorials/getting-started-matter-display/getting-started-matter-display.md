## Overview

The Nano Matter Display is an evaluation kit for the Nano Matter that features an extension board from Pervasive Displays. It includes a 2.9 inches (384x168) E-ink monochrome high-definition display, a temperature and humidity sensor, a 3-axis accelerometer and an addressable RGB LED.

### Nano Matter Display Main Features

![Nano Matter Hardware Overview]()

The Nano Matter Display include the following features:

- **E-ink display:** a 2.9 inches (384x168) E-ink monochrome high-definition display with a wide temperature working range and fast update.
- **RGB LED:** a WS2813C addressable RGB LED for visual status feedback.
- **3-axis accelerometer:** a MEMS digital output motion sensor (LIS2DH12).
- **Temperature and humidity sensor:** a HDC2080 Low-Power humidity and temperature digital sensor.
- **Flexible power options:** can be powered by a pair of CR2032 3V batteries or through the USB connector of the Arduino Nano.
