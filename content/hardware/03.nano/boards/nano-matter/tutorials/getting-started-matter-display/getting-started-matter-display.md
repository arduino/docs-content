## Overview

The Nano Matter Display is an evaluation kit for the Nano Matter that features an extension board from Pervasive Displays. It includes a 2.9 inches (384x168) E-ink monochrome high-definition display, a temperature and humidity sensor, a three axes accelerometer and an addressable RGB LED.

These features are meant to be leveraged with the Arduino Nano Matter to extend the board capabilities and allow the user to create interesting and useful applications around the E-ink display.
