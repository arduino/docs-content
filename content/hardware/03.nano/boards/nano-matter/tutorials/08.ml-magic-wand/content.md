## Overview

This tutorial describes how to build a gesture recognition system based on a machine learning model using TensorFlow and the Arduino Nano Matter.

The Arduino Nano Matter acts as a digital magic wand ðŸª„, where sensor data from its movements is processed by a model to classify and detect specific gestures. The inference results will tur

## Hardware and Software Requirements
### Hardware Requirements

- [Arduino Nano Matter](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nano-matter) (x1)
- Nano Connector Carrier (x1)
- Modulino Movement (x1)
- Modulino Pixels (x1)
- Qwiic cables (x2)
- [USB-CÂ® cable](https://store.arduino.cc/products/usb-cable2in1-type-c) (x1)
- Custom 3D printed parts

### Software Requirements

- [Arduino IDE 2.0+](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [Arduino Cloud Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor)
- [Modulino library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Modulino). This library adds the support for the Modulinos, you can install it from the **Library Manager** in the Arduino IDE.
- [Silicon Labs core](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/arduino). This enables the Silicon Labs hardware including the Arduino Nano Matter support. You can install it from the **Boards Manager** in the Arduino IDE.
