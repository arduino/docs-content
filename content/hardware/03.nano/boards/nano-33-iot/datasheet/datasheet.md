# Description 
The Arduino® Nano 33 IoT and Arduino Nano 33 IoT with headers are a miniature sized module containing a Cortex M0+ SAMD21 processor, a Wi-Fi® + Bluetooth® module based on ESP32, a crypto chip which can securely store certificates and pre-shared keys and a 6 axis IMU. The module can either be mounted as a DIP component (when mounting pin headers), or as a SMT component, directly soldering it via the castellated pads.

## The Board
As all Nano form factor boards, Nano 33 IoT and Nano 33 IoT with headers does not have a battery charger but can be powered through USB or headers.

**NOTE:** Nano 33 IoT and Nano 33 IoT with headers only supports 3.3V I/Os and is **NOT** 5V tolerant so please make sure you are not directly connecting 5V signals to this board or it will be damaged. Also, as opposed to Arduino Nano boards that support 5V operation, the 5V pin does NOT supply voltage but is rather connected, through a jumper, to the USB power input.

### Application Examples
**Weather station:** Using the Nano 33 IoT or Nano 33 IoT with headers together with a sensor and a OLED display, we can create a small weather station communicating temperature, humidity etc. directly  to your phone.

**Air quality monitor:** Bad air quality may have serious effects on your health. By assembling the board, with a sensor and monitor you can make sure that the air quality is kept in indoor-environments. By connecting the hardware assembly to an IoT application/API, you will receive real time values.

**Air drum:** A quick and fun project is to create a small air drum. Connect your board and upload your sketch from the Arduino Cloud Editor and start creating beats with your audio workstation of your choice.

### Processor 
The Main Processor is a Arm® Cortex®-M0+ running at up to 48 MHz. Most of its pins are connected to the external headers, however some are reserved for internal communication with the wireless module and the on-board internal I<sup>2</sup>C peripherals (IMU and Crypto). 

**NOTE**: As opposed to other Arduino Nano boards, pins A4 and A5 have an internal pull up and default to be used as an I<sup>2</sup>C Bus so usage as analog inputs is not recommended.

Communication with NINA W102 happens through a serial port and a SPI bus through the following pins.

### Wi-Fi®/Bluetooth® Communication Module
Nina W102 is based on ESP32 and is delivered with a pre-certified software stack from Arduino. Source code for the firmware is available **[13]**.

**NOTE:** Reprogramming the wireless module’s firmware with a custom one will invalidate compliance with radio standards as certified by Arduino, hence this is not recommended unless the application is used in private laboratories far from other electronic equipment and people. Usage of custom firmware on radio modules is the sole responsibility of the user.

Some of the module’s pins are connected to the external headers and can be directly driven by ESP32 provided SAMD21’s corresponding pins are aptly tri-stated. Below is a list of such signals:

| **SAMD21 Pin** | **SAMD21 Acronym** | **NINA Pin** | **NINA Acronym** | **Description** |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 48             | PB03               | 8            | GPIO21           | A7              |
| 14             | PA09               | 5            | GPIO32           | A6              |
| 8              | PB09               | 31           | GPIO14           | A5/SCL          |
| 7              | PB08               | 35           | GPIO13           | A4/SDA          |

### Crypto
The crypto chip in Arduino IoT boards is what makes the difference with other less secure boards as it provides a secure way to store secrets (such as certificates) and accelerates secure protocols while never exposing secrets in plain text.

Source code for the Arduino Library that supports the Crypto is available **[14]**


### IMU
The board has an embedded 6-axis IMU which can be used to measure board orientation (by checking the gravity acceleration vector orientation) or to measure shocks, vibration, acceleration and rotation speed.

Source code for the Arduino Library that supports the IMU is available **[15]**

### Power Tree

## Board Operation 
### Getting Started - IDE 
If you want to program your board while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE [1] To connect the Nano 33 IoT to your computer, you’ll need a Micro-B USB cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor 
All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Cloud Editor [2], by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud 
All Arduino IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud which allows you to Log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Sample Sketches
Sample sketches for the Nano 33 IoT can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino IDE or in the “Documentation” section of the Arduino Docs website [4].

### Online Resources
Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on Arduino Project Hub **[5]**, the Arduino Library Reference **[6]** and the online store **[7]** where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more

### Board Recovery
All Arduino boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after power up.

Exemptions : No exemptions are claimed. 

Arduino Boards are fully compliant with the related requirements of European Union Regulation (EC) 1907 /2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We declare none of the SVHCs (https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table), the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern for authorization currently released by ECHA, is present in all products (and also package) in quantities totaling in a concentration equal or above 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.

### Conflict Minerals Declaration 
As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regards to laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder, or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas.
