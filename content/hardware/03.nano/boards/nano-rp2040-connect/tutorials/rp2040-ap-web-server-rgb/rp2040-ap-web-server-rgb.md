## Introduction 

The Nano RP2040 Connect features a Wi-Fi module and an RGB LED among many other things. In this tutorial we will take a look at how we turn our board into an access point, and control the built-in RGB through a browser connected to the access point.

>**Note:** if you need help setting up your environment to use your Arduino Nano RP2040 board, please refer to [this installation guide](/software/ide-v2/tutorials/ide-v2-board-manager).

## Goals

The goals of this project are:

- Create an access point (AP).
- Set up a web server.
- Connect to the server through a browser.
- Control the RGB LED.

## Hardware & Software Needed

- Arduino IDE ([online](https://create.arduino.cc/) or [offline](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)).
- [WiFiNINA](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiNINA) library.
- [Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect](https://store.arduino.cc/nano-rp2040-connect).


### Circuit

## Controlling over Wi-Fi

There are multiple ways we can access our board over Wi-Fi. In this tutorial, we will turn our board into a web server, that will listen for incoming GET requests. 

Simply explained, we will set up our board as an access point, and start hosting a web server on a specific IP address. The device will now show up in the list of available Wi-Fi networks on for example your smartphone or computer.

If we connect to this access point, and enter the board's address in the browser of a computer/browser on the same network, we make a request to this server. The server responds with a set of HTML instructions, which can then be viewed in the browser.  

### Controlling an Arduino Through the Browser

Inside the HTML instructions that we print, or send to the browser, we can create **buttons.** These buttons can be modified to add something to the URL. Here is an example of how a button is created:

```markup
<button class='red' type='submit' onmousedown='location.href=\"/RH\"'>ON</button>
```

The most important is what we put inside `href`, which in this case is `/RH`. Whenever this button is clicked, it will update the URL of the page to `http://<board-ip>/RH`. After this happens, the program will go through a set of conditionals, that checks whether this button has been pressed:

```arduino
        if (currentLine.endsWith("GET /RH")) {
          doSomething();
        }
```

By using this method, we can set up many more buttons that can control different aspects of our Arduino, and is a great building block for creating a control interface for your board that can be controlled through a browser, over Wi-Fi.

## Programming the Board

We will now get to the programming part of this tutorial. 

1. First, let's make sure we have the drivers installed. If we are using the Cloud Editor, we do not need to install anything. If we are using an offline editor, we need to install it manually. This can be done by navigating to **Tools > Board > Board Manager...**. Here we need to look for the **Arduino Mbed OS Nano Boards** and install it.  

2. Now, we need to install the libraries needed. If we are using the Cloud Editor, there is no need to install anything. If we are using an offline editor, simply go to **Tools > Manage libraries..**, and search for **WiFiNINA** and install it.

3. We can now take a look at some of the core functions of this sketch:

- `char ssid[] = ""` - create a network name.
- `char pass[] = ""` - create a network password.
- `WiFi.beginAP(ssid, pass)` - creates an access point with the stored credentials.
- `WiFiServer server(80)` - creates a server that listens for incoming connections on the specified port.
- `WiFiClient client` - creates a client that can connect to to a specified internet IP address.
- `server.begin()` - tells the server to begin listening for incoming connections.
- `client.connected` - checks for connected clients.
- `client.available` - checks for available data.
- `client.read` - reads the available data.
- `client.print()` - print something to the client (e.g. html code).
- `client.stop()` - closes the connection.

The sketch can be found in the snippet below. Upload the sketch to the board. 

***Note: both `ssid` and `pass` needs to be a minimum of 8 characters long***  

```arduino
#include <SPI.h>
#include <WiFiNINA.h>

char ssid[] = "yournetwork";        // your network SSID (name)
char pass[] = "yourpassword";    // your network password (use for WPA, or use as key for WEP)
int keyIndex = 0;                // your network key index number (needed only for WEP)

int status = WL_IDLE_STATUS;
WiFiServer server(80);

void setup() {
  //Initialize serial and wait for port to open:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  }

  Serial.println("Access Point Web Server");

  pinMode(LEDR, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LEDG, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LEDB, OUTPUT);

  // check for the WiFi module:
  if (WiFi.status() == WL_NO_MODULE) {
    Serial.println("Communication with WiFi module failed!");
    // don't continue
    while (true);
  }

  String fv = WiFi.firmwareVersion();
  if (fv < WIFI_FIRMWARE_LATEST_VERSION) {
    Serial.println("Please upgrade the firmware");
  }

  // by default the local IP address will be 192.168.4.1
  // you can override it with the following:
  // WiFi.config(IPAddress(10, 0, 0, 1));

  // print the network name (SSID);
  Serial.print("Creating access point named: ");
  Serial.println(ssid);

  // Create open network. Change this line if you want to create an WEP network:
  status = WiFi.beginAP(ssid, pass);
  if (status != WL_AP_LISTENING) {
    Serial.println("Creating access point failed");
    // don't continue
    while (true);
  }

  // wait 10 seconds for connection:
  delay(10000);

  // start the web server on port 80
  server.begin();

  // you're connected now, so print out the status
  printWiFiStatus();
}


void loop() {
  // compare the previous status to the current status
  if (status != WiFi.status()) {
    // it has changed update the variable
    status = WiFi.status();

    if (status == WL_AP_CONNECTED) {
      // a device has connected to the AP
      Serial.println("Device connected to AP");
    } else {
      // a device has disconnected from the AP, and we are back in listening mode
      Serial.println("Device disconnected from AP");
    }
  }
  
  WiFiClient client = server.available();   // listen for incoming clients

   if (client) {                             // if you get a client,
    Serial.println("new client");           // print a message out the serial port
    String currentLine = "";                // make a String to hold incoming data from the client
    while (client.connected()) {            // loop while the client's connected
      if (client.available()) {             // if there's bytes to read from the client,
        char c = client.read();             // read a byte, then
        Serial.write(c);                    // print it out the serial monitor
        if (c == '\n') {                    // if the byte is a newline character

          // if the current line is blank, you got two newline characters in a row.
          // that's the end of the client HTTP request, so send a response:
          if (currentLine.length() == 0) {
            // HTTP headers always start with a response code (e.g. HTTP/1.1 200 OK)
            // and a content-type so the client knows what's coming, then a blank line:
            client.println("HTTP/1.1 200 OK");
            client.println("Content-type:text/html");
            client.println();

            // the content of the HTTP response follows the header:
            client.print("<style>");
            client.print(".container {margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; margin-top: 100px;}");
            client.print("button {color: white; width: 100px; height: 100px;");
            client.print("border-radius: 50%; margin: 20px; border: none; font-size: 20px; outline: none; transition: all 0.2s;}");

            client.print(".blue {background-color: rgb(5, 87, 180);}");
            client.print(".off{background-color: grey;}");
            client.print("button:hover{cursor: pointer; opacity: 0.7;}");
            client.print("</style>");
            client.print("<div class='container'>");
            client.print("<button class='red' type='submit' onmousedown='location.href=\"/RH\"'>ON</button>");
            client.print("<button class='off' type='submit' onmousedown='location.href=\"/RL\"'>OFF</button><br>");

            client.print("<button class='off' type='submit' onmousedown='location.href=\"/BL\"'>OFF</button>");
            client.print("</div>");

            // The HTTP response ends with another blank line:
            client.println();
            // break out of the while loop:
            break;
          } else {    // if you got a newline, then clear currentLine:
            currentLine = "";
          }
        } else if (c != '\r') {  // if you got anything else but a carriage return character,
          currentLine += c;      // add it to the end of the currentLine
        }

        // Check to see if the client request was /X

void printWiFiStatus() {

  Serial.println(WiFi.SSID());

  Serial.println(ip);

}
```

## Testing It Out

After the code has been successfully uploaded to the board, we need to open the Serial Monitor to initialize the program.

When we open it, it will attempt to create an access point, and if it is successful, it will print out the boards IP address in the Serial Monitor.

![Access point created.](assets/rp2040-ap-mode-img-02.png)

We will now need to connect to this access point through either our smartphone or computer, by browsing the list of available networks.

![Finding your network.](assets/rp2040-ap-mode-img-04.png)

Once we have connected, we need to copy the enter the address that was printed in the Serial Monitor, in the browser of our device. We should now see a web page with a set of colored buttons.

![Accessing the board from the browser.](assets/rp2040-ap-mode-img-05.png)

We can now interact with the different buttons. The buttons available are used to control the built-in RGB LED on the Nano RP2040 Connect. There's six buttons in total, three to turn ON the different colors, and three to turn them off.  

### Troubleshoot

If the code is not working, there are some common issues we can troubleshoot:

- We have entered the wrong credentials to our Wi-Fi network.
- We have not installed the **WiFiNINA** library.
- The WiFiNINA library is updated (can be done in the library manager).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have turned our Nano RP2040 Connect into a web server, which different clients can connect to. We have then used the /GET method in order to change the RGB LED on the board, through a set of buttons accessible from the browser.

This method can be quite useful for turning something ON or OFF remotely, and can be an ideal solution for building smart home applications. You can easily replace the control of the RGB LED with something else, such as controlling a motor, relays or other actuators.
