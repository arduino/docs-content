# Description

The **Arduino® Nano 33 BLE Rev2**\* is a miniature-sized module containing a NINA B306 module, based on Nordic nRF52480 and containing an Arm® Cortex®-M4F. The BMI270 and BMM150 jointly provide a 9-axis IMU. The module can either be mounted as a DIP component (when mounting pin headers) or as a SMT component, directly soldering it via the castellated pads.

\*Nano 33 BLE Rev2 product has two SKUs:

- Without headers (ABX00071)
- With headers (ABX00072)

## The Board

As all Nano form factor boards, Nano 33 BLE Rev2 does not have a battery charger but can be powered through USB or headers.

**NOTE:** Nano 33 BLE Rev2 only supports 3.3 V I/Os and is **NOT** 5V tolerant so please make sure you are not directly connecting 5 V signals to this board or it will be damaged. Also, as opposed to other Arduino Nano boards that support 5 V operation, the 5V pin does NOT supply voltage but is rather connected, through a jumper, to the USB power input.

### Processor

The Main Processor is an Arm® Cortex®-M4F running at up to 64 MHz. Most of its pins are connected to the external headers however some are reserved for internal communication with the wireless module and the on-board internal I<sup>2</sup>C peripherals (IMU and Crypto).

**NOTE**: As opposed to other Arduino Nano boards, pins A4 and A5 have an internal pull-up and default to be used as an I<sup>2</sup>C Bus so usage as analog inputs is not recommended.

### IMU

Nano 33 BLE Rev2 provides IMU capabilities with 9-axis, through a combination of the BMI270 and BMM150 ICs. The BMI270 includes both a three-axis gyroscope as well as a three-axis accelerometer, while the BMM150 is capable of sensing magnetic field variations in all three dimensions. The information obtained can be used for measuring raw movement parameters as well as for machine learning.

### Power Tree

The board can be powered via USB connector, V<sub>IN</sub> or V<sub>USB</sub> pins on headers.

![Power tree](assets/Nano_33_BLE_Rev2_Power_Tree.svg)

**NOTE:** Since V<sub>USB</sub> feeds V<sub>IN</sub> via a Schottky diode and a DC-DC regulator specified minimum input voltage is 4.5 V the minimum supply voltage from USB has to be increased to a voltage in the range between 4.8 V to 4.96 V depending on the current being drawn.

## Board Operation

### Getting Started - IDE

If you want to program your Nano 33 BLE Rev2 while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE [1] To connect the Nano 33 BLE Rev2 to your computer, you’ll need a Micro-B USB cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor

All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Cloud Editor [2], by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow [3] to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud

All Arduino IoT-enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud which allows you to log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Sample Sketches

Sample sketches for the Nano 33 BLE Sense can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino IDE or in the “Built-in Examples” section of the Arduino Docs website.

### Online Resources

Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on Arduino Project Hub [4], the Arduino Library Reference [5] and the online store where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.

### Board Recovery

All Arduino boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after powering up the board.
