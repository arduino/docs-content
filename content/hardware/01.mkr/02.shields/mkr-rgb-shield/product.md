The MKR RGB Shield is a great for creating simple light installations out of the box! With 84 programmable RGBs in a 12x7 matrix, you can use it to create scrolling texts, create simple animations or even use it to create retro games.

To use this shield, you can refer to the documentation of the [MKR RGB library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/arduino_mkrrgb/).
