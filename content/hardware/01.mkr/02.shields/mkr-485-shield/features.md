<FeatureDescription>

The MKR 485 Shield is based on the **MAXIM MAX3157** transceiver, which guarantees data rates at up to 250kbps. The shield can be switched from using a half-duplex communication (one direction at a time) or full-duplex (both directions at the same time), which is easily configured by a switch on board the shield. It also features the **TPS54232** buck converter from Texas Instruments.
