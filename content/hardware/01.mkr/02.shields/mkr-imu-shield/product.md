The MKR IMU Shield helps you integrate inertial measurements with your projects. Read three-dimensional acceleration, yaw rate and magnetical field by simply mounting it on top of a MKR family board.

To use this shield, you can refer to the documentation of the [MKR IMU library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/mkrimu/).
