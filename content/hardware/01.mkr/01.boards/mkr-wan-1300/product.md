The Arduino MKR WAN 1300 was the first LoRa® board released by Arduino, offering a practical and cost-effective solution with minimal power requirements. This open source board can connect to the Arduino Cloud, your own LoRa-based network using the Arduino LoRa® PRO Gateway, existing public networks such as The Things Network (TTN) or even other boards using direct connectivity mode.
