The Arduino MKR WAN 1300 was the first LoRa® board released by Arduino, as a practical and cost effective solution with minimal power requirements. This open source board can connect to the Arduino IoT Cloud, your own LoRa® network using the Arduino LoRa® PRO Gateway, existing LoRaWAN® infrastructure like The Things Network, or even other boards using the direct connectivity mode.
