The Arduino MKR WAN 1300 was the first LoRa速 board released by Arduino, as a practical and cost effective solution with minimal power requirements. This open source board can connect to the Arduino Cloud, your own LoRa速 network using the Arduino LoRa速 PRO Gateway, existing LoRaWAN速 infrastructure like The Things Network, or even other boards using the direct connectivity mode.
