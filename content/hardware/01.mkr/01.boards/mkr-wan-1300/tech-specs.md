Here you will find the technical specifications for the Arduino MKR WAN 1300.

**Please read: operating voltage is 3.3V**

The microcontroller on the this board runs at 3.3V, which means that you must never apply more than 3.3V to its Digital and Analog pins. Care must be taken when connecting sensors and actuators to assure that this limit of 3.3V is never exceeded. Connecting higher voltage signals, like the 5V commonly used with the other Arduino boards, will damage the board.

**Please read: black conductive foam**

You should remove the black conductive foam from the board pins before usage. If you don't remove it, the board may behave erratically.
