<FeatureDescription>
The MKR VIDOR 4000 is nothing less than a powerhouse of a board, packing a huge set of features into a small form factor. It features the <b>Intel速 Cyclone速 10CL016</b> for FPGA (Field Programming Gate Array), allowing you to configure a large set of pins to accommodate any of your preferences. But why stop there? The board also has a camera connector, a Micro HDMI connector, Wi-Fi / Bluetooth速 connectivity through the <b>NINA-W102</b> module, and cyber-security through the <b>ECC508</b> crypto chip. Just as the other members of the MKR family, it uses the popular <b>Cortex-M0 32-bit SAMD21</b> microprocessor.
