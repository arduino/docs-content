 Introduction 

In this tutorial, we will create a setup that allows a MKR GSM 1400 board to **publish** and **subscribe** to topics, using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport). For simplicity, we will use the same device to both publish and subscribe to the same topic.

## Goals

The goals of this project are:

- Connect to the GSM network.
- Connect to a broker ([shiftr.io](https://shiftr.io/))
- Publish a topic using MQTT.
- Subscribe to the same topic.
- Print the results in the Serial Monitor.

## Hardware & Software Needed

- Arduino IDE ([online](https://create.arduino.cc/) or [offline](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)).
- [MKRGSM](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/GSM) library installed. 
- [MQTT](https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt) library installed. 
- [Arduino MKR GSM 1400](https://store.arduino.cc/mkr-gsm-1400).
- [Antenna](https://store.arduino.cc/antenna).
- SIM card from an operator in your country.


## Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)

The MQTT protocol was first introduced in 1999, as a light-weight **publish** and **subscribe** system. It is particularly useful for devices with low-bandwidth, where we can send commands, sensor values or messages over the Internet with little effort. 

A basic explanation on how it works is that a node, for example and Arduino with a Wi-Fi module, sends a payload to a broker. A broker is a kind of "middle-point" server, that essentially stores payloads sent to it, in something called **topics**. A topic, is a definition of what type of data it contains, it could for example be "basement humidity" or "living room temperature". Another node can then subscribe to this information, from the broker, and voilà, data has been moved from Node A to Node B over the Internet.

There are several different ways this can be practiced, with many different layers of security depending on what type of broker and setup we use. For example, if we are dealing with non-sensitive data, such as the temperature of a specific location, we are not too concerned on who might get access to it. But there's cases where data needs to be protected, for example in Social Media messaging services. 

One way to protect the data, is to for example use a **token**, something that is quite common when working with various IoT services. For instance, if we are publishing something to a broker, anyone who has the URL, e.g. **randombroker.org/randomtopic** can subscribe to it. But if we added a unique token on both sides, they wouldn't. These tokens could for example be **Z6ACuLwr5T**, which is not exactly something easy to guess.

### Circuit

## Creating the Program

We will now get to the programming part of this tutorial. 

**1.** First, let's make sure we have the drivers installed. If we are using the Cloud Editor, we do not need to install anything. If we are using an offline editor, we need to install it manually. This can be done by navigating to **Tools > Board > Board Manager...**. Here we need to look for the **Arduino SAMD boards (32-bits Arm® Cortex®-M0+)** and install it. 

**2.** Now, we need to install the libraries needed. If we are using the Cloud Editor, there is no need to install anything. If we are using an offline editor, simply go to **Tools > Manage libraries..**, and search for **MKRGSM** and install it. 

**3.** We will also need to install the **MQTT** library, by Joel Gaehwiler. 
 
>**Note:** there are several MQTT libraries, make sure you install the right one! The image below highlights the library that needs to be installed.

![Installing the MQTT library.](assets/MKRGSM_T5_IMG02.png)


**4.** We can now take a look at some of the core functions of this sketch:

- `pin[]` - stores the pin number of your card.
- `apn[]` - stores the APN of your operator.
- `login[]` - stores the login to your operator (typically a blank field).
- `password[]` - stores the password to your operator (typically a blank field).

- `GSM gsmAccess` - base class for all GSM based functions.
- `GSMClient net` - creates a GSM client.
- `GPRS gprs` - base class for GPRS functions, e.g. Internet, server behaviors.
- `MQTTClient client` - creates a client that can connect to a broker, and publish/subscribe to topics and messages.
- `client.begin(broker, net)` - connects to the broker.
- `client.publish(topic, message)` - publishes a topic with a message.
- `client.subscribe(topic)` - subscribes to a topic.  

The sketch can be found in the snippet below. Upload the sketch to the board.

```cpp

#include <MKRGSM.h>
#include <MQTT.h>

const char pin[]      = "";
const char apn[]      = "apn";
const char login[]    = "login";
const char password[] = "password";

GSMClient net;
GPRS gprs;
GSM gsmAccess;
MQTTClient client;

unsigned long lastMillis = 0;

void connect() {
  // connection state
  bool connected = false;

  Serial.print("connecting to cellular network ...");

  // After starting the modem with gsmAccess.begin()
  // attach to the GPRS network with the APN, login and password
  while (!connected) {
    if ((gsmAccess.begin(pin) == GSM_READY) &&
        (gprs.attachGPRS(apn, login, password) == GPRS_READY)) {
      connected = true;
    } else {
      Serial.print(".");
      delay(1000);
    }
  }

  Serial.print("\nconnecting...");
  while (!client.connect("arduino", "try", "try")) {
    Serial.print(".");
    delay(1000);
  }

  Serial.println("\nconnected!");

  client.subscribe("/hello");
  // client.unsubscribe("/hello");
}

void messageReceived(String &topic, String &payload) {
  Serial.println("incoming: " + topic + " - " + payload);

  // Note: Do not use the client in the callback to publish, subscribe or
  // unsubscribe as it may cause deadlocks when other things arrive while
  // sending and receiving acknowledgments. Instead, change a global variable,
  // or push to a queue and handle it in the loop after calling `client.loop()`.
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Note: Local domain names (e.g. "Computer.local" on OSX) are not supported
  // by Arduino. You need to set the IP address directly.
  client.begin("broker.shiftr.io", net);
  client.onMessage(messageReceived);

  connect();
}

void loop() {
  client.loop();

  if (!client.connected()) {
    connect();
  }

  // publish a message roughly every second.
  if (millis() - lastMillis > 1000) {
    lastMillis = millis();
    client.publish("/hello", "world");
  }
}
```

## Testing It Out

After you have uploaded the code to the board, open the Serial Monitor to initialize the program. If it is successful, after 10 seconds or so, it will print `connected`, followed by the message: `incoming: /hello - world`. 

![Subscribing to a topic in serial monitor.](assets/MKRGSM_T5_IMG03.png)

This means that we have successfully published, and subscribed to a topic, using the **shiftr.io** broker. Right now our message is very general, and there is a good chance that someone is using this very same topic and message, but we can actually go and see a live visualization of the messages that goes through the broker. To see this visualization, go to [shiftr.io/try](https://shiftr.io/try), and start looking for your message!

We can now start experimenting with the code, to make it a bit more interesting. Some changes we can make include:

- Changing the topic (hello) and message (world). This can be done by editing the commands `client.subscribe("/hello")` and `client.publish("/hello", "world")`.  

- Create more topics to publish and subscribe to. Just duplicate the same two commands as above, but create unique topics, such as "pinkfoxtail" or "funkybanana". This will further decrease the likelihood that someone is using the same topics!
  
### Troubleshoot

If the code is not working, there are some common issues we can troubleshoot:

- We have not installed the **MKRGSM** library.
- We have not installed the **MQTT** library.
- We have entered the wrong pin number.
- We have entered the wrong APN (access point name, check the operator of the SIM card).
- We are out of coverage (no signal).
- SIM card may not be activated.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have combined the use of the GSM technology, with the MQTT communication protocol. Both are incredibly useful and popular in IoT projects, as they consume small amounts of data, are easily customizable and have great coverage all over the world.
