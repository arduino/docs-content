## The Board

### Application Examples

**Light controller:** Control your house lightning with the MKR IoT Carrier, using the RGB light sensor. This feature identifies the general amount of light in a room or environment and adapts. If the board is connected to Wi-Fi®, you can manage and control your device remotely on a smartphone via the Arduino Cloud.

**Light and water controller for greenhouse:** With moisture sensor, pressure sensor and temperature the MKR IoT Carrier can evaluate and recognize the moisture of the soil, depending on air humidity and sun. Through the various sensors, it can reconstruate suitable climate (e.g. tropical) with the help of heaters and relays to increase the humidity. It can also be programmed with a watering system thanks to the relays. 

**Weather station:** With temperature sensor, pressure sensor, humidity sensor and light sensors,  you can easily use your MKR IoT Carrier as a local weather station. The various sensors can via sensors collect statistics about the different variables required to display weather.

### Power Tree

The MKR IoT Carrier makes use of the power management features of the Arduino MKR boards to power itself as well as to interface with the Li-Ion battery. 

![Power tree](assets/Power_Tree_MKR_IoT_Carrier.png)

### Solution Overview

![Solution overview](assets/solution_overview.png)

The MKR IoT Carrier is also a part of the Arduino® Oplà IoT Kit, that in addition to the carrier contains an MKR WiFi 1010, a motion sensor, moisture sensor, USB cable and a protective case.  

## Board Operation

### Getting Started - IDE 
If you want to program your MKR IoT Carrier while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE **[1]**. To connect the MKR IoT Carrier to your computer, you’ll need a Micro-B USB cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor 

All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Cloud Editor **[2]**, by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud 
All Arduino IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud which allows you to Log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Sample Sketches 
Sample sketches for the MKR IoT Carrier can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino IDE or in the Oplà IoT Kit platform **[4]** and further documentation can be found in Arduino Documentation **[8]** which also contains links to the troubleshooting articles.

### Online Resources

Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on Arduino Project Hub **[5]**, the Arduino Library Reference **[6]** and the online store **[7]** where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more

### Board Recovery 
All Arduino boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after power up.
