## Functional Overview
The Modulino® Distance node uses a **time-of-flight** measuring principle to detect objects from 0 to ~1200 mm. It communicates via I2C (through the Qwiic connector at 3.3 V). **GPIO1** can signal an interrupt when a threshold is reached or measurement is ready, while **XSHUT** can place the sensor in shutdown mode to save power.

### I2C Address Reference
| **Board Silk Name** | **Sensor**       | **Modulino® I2C Address (HEX)** | **Editable Addresses (HEX)**              | **Hardware I2C Address (HEX)** |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| MODULINO DISTANCE   | VL53L4CDV0DH/1   | 0x29                           | Any custom address (via software config.) | 0x29                           |

**Note:** The default address is **0x29**. Multiple units of the same sensor may require address reconfiguration in software to avoid collisions.

## Device Operation
The Modulino® Distance node operates as an I2C target device on the Qwiic bus. A host microcontroller can read distance values, set thresholds, or configure measurement timing. If using multiple distance sensors, you may need to set unique addresses or toggle XSHUT lines.

### Getting Started
Use any standard Arduino or microcontroller environment at 3.3 V. Library support for the VL53 series sensors can simplify reading distance measurements. Ensure the sensor’s field of view is unobstructed for accurate results.
