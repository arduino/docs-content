## Functional Overview
The Modulino® Buzzer node receives sound commands or frequency/tone data via I2C. The STM32C011F4 microcontroller then drives the buzzer, producing audible tones or beeps. For more advanced usage, users can re-flash the firmware via SWD to generate custom waveforms or integrate additional logic.

#### Pull-up Resistors

The module has pads for optional I2C pull-up mounting in both data lines. No resistors are mounted by default but in case the resistors are need 4.7 K resistors in an SMD 0402 format are recommended.

These are positioned near the Qwiic connector on the power LED side.

## Device Operation
By default, the Modulino® Buzzer node responds to I2C commands to produce tones or beep patterns. You can integrate it with the Arduino IDE or any 3.3 V microcontroller environment. Advanced users may flash custom code via the SWD header to implement unique waveforms or logic.
