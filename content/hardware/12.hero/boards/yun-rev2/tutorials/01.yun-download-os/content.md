Here you can find the necessary download links to GNU/Linux OS to use with your Arduino Yún Rev2 board.

## OpenWRT - Yún 1.5.3 Upgrade Image

Download the latest stable GNU/Linux OS for your Yún. It makes your Yún more stable and feature rich.

### Easy Installation Procedure (Recommended)

Follow the steps in the [Yún Sys Upgrade tutorial](./yun-sys-upgrade).

### Advanced Installation Procedure

This procedure is only recommended to advanced users who wish to completely re-flash the Yún including its U-Boot bootloader. [These instructions](./yun-u-boot-reflash) on reflashing the base images are for reference only. Following them will void your Yún's warranty.
