### Service Provider Compatibility and End-Device Certification
Please be aware that the Portenta Cat. M1/NB IoT GNSS Shield is not certified as an end device by all cellular network providers. 

If you encounter difficulties with network connection, we recommend checking with your service provider to verify if End-Device certification is required for network access. Switching to a provider that does not have such requirements may resolve these issues.

We advise reviewing this compatibility information during setup to ensure optimal device performance and to prevent potential service interruptions.

### Positioning
Four major GNSS systems are supported by the **Arduino® Portenta Cat. M1/NB IoT GNSS Shield**. NMEA protocol is used for the transmission of GNSS information. An active antenna can be connected via the micro UFL connector (J8) and should have a bias voltage of 3.0V. The input impedance for the GNSS antenna connector is 50Ω. For compatibility with all GNSS systems, the antenna should support bands over the 1559 - 1606 MHz frequency range.
