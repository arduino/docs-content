<Feature title="Chrom-ART graphical hardware Accelerator™" image="mcu">

  Probably one of the most exciting features of the Portenta H7 is the possibility of connecting an external monitor to build your own dedicated embedded computer with a user interface. This is possible thanks to the STM32H747 processor's on-chip GPU, the Chrom-ART Accelerator™. Besides the GPU, the chip includes a dedicated JPEG encoder and decoder.
