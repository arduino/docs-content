# Description

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Portenta UWB Shield, based on the Truesense DCU150 module, is a versatile Ultra-Wideband (UWB) communication solution. It integrates with the Arduino Portenta C33 board via its High-Density connectors and functions as a base station for two-way ranging and real-time location services (RTLS). The shield features the Truesense DCU150 module, which incorporates the NXP® Trimension™ SR150 UWB integrated circuit (IC), three embedded PCB antennas, onboard power management, clock control, filters and peripheral components. With 1.8 to 3.3 VDC level shifters and dual High-Density board-to-board connectors, it plugs directly into the Portenta C33 board.</p>
