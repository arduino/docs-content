# Description

The Arduino® Portenta X8 is a high-performance system on module designed to power the upcoming generation of the Industrial Internet of Things. This board combines the NXP® i.MX 8M Mini (4+1-cores) hosting an embedded Linux OS with the STM32H7 (2-cores) for real-time applications in the Arduino environment. Shield and carrier boards are available to extend the functionality of the Portenta X8 or alternatively can be used as reference designs to develop your own custom solutions.

## Processor

The Arduino Portenta X8 makes use of two Arm®-based physical processing units.

### NXP® i.MX 8M Mini Quad Core Microprocessor

The MIMX8MM6CVTKZAA iMX8M (U2) features a quad-core Arm® Cortex® A53 running at up to 1.8 GHz for high-performance applications alongside an Arm® Cortex® M4 running at up to 400 MHz. The Arm® Cortex® A53 is capable of running a fully-fledged Linux or Android operating system through a Board Support Packages (BSP) in a multithreaded fashion. This can be expanded via the use of specialized software containers via OTA updates. The Arm® Cortex® M4 has lower power consumption allowing for effective sleep management as well as optimal performance in real-time applications and is reserved for future use. Both processors can share all peripherals and resources available on the i.MX 8M Mini, including PCIe, on-chip memory, GPIO, GPU and Audio.

### STM32 Dual Core Microprocessor

The X8 includes an embedded H7 in the form of a STM32H747AII6 IC (U20) with a dual-core Arm® Cortex® M7 and Arm® Cortex® M4. This IC is used as an I/O expander for the NXP® i.MX 8M Mini (U2). Peripherals are automatically controlled via the M7 core. Additionally, the M4 core is available for real-time control of motors and other time-critical machinery at a barebones level. The M7 core acts as a mediator between the peripherals and the i.MX 8M Mini. It achieves this by running a custom firmware [https://github.com/arduino/portentax8-stm32h7-fw](https://github.com/arduino/portentax8-stm32h7-fw) normally invisible to the User, which maps all its peripherals as Linux devices. Advanced users can customize the M7 firmware to fit their needs but this could break the seamless Linux integration. Users are instead encouraged to write custom Arduino programs (sketches) running on the M4, which can access all the peripherals supported by the M7. The STM32H7 is not exposed to networking and should be programmed via the i.MX 8M Mini (U2).

## Wi-Fi®/Bluetooth® Connectivity

The Murata® LBEE5KL1DX-883 wireless module (U9) simultaneously provides Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® connectivity in an ultra-small package based on the Cypress CYW4343W. The IEEE 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi® interface can be operated as an access point (AP), station (STA) or as dual-mode simultaneous AP/STA and supports a maximum transfer rate of 65 Mbps. Bluetooth® interface supports Bluetooth® Classic and Bluetooth® Low Energy. An integrated antenna circuitry switch allows a single external antenna (J4 or ANT1) to be shared between Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth®. Module U9 interfaces with i.MX 8M Mini (U2) via a 4bit SDIO and UART interface. Based on the software stack of the wireless module in the embedded Linux OS, Bluetooth® 5.1 is supported together with Wi-Fi® conforming to the IEEE802.11b/g/n standard.

The Arduino® Portenta X8 includes two onboard memory modules. A NT6AN512T32AV 2GB LP-DDR4 DRAM (U19) and 16GB Forsee eMMC Flash module (FEMDRW016G) (U5) are accessible to the i.MX 8M Mini (U2).

## Crypto Capabilities

The Arduino® Portenta X8 enables IC-level edge-to-cloud security capability through the NXP® SE050C2 Crypto chip (U11). This provides Common Criteria EAL 6+ security certification up to OS level, as well as RSA/ECC cryptographic algorithm support and credential storage. It interacts with the NXP® i.MX 8M Mini via I2C.

## Gigabit Ethernet

The NXP® i.MX 8M Mini Quad includes a 10/100/1000 Ethernet controller with support for Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE), Ethernet AVB, and IEEE 1588. An external physical connector is required to complete the interface. This can be accessed via a high-density connector with an external component such as the Arduino® Portenta Breakout board.

## USB-C® Connector

![USB-C® Pinout](assets/usbCPinout.png)
The USB-C® connector provides multiple connectivity options over a single physical interface:

- Provide board power supply in both DFP and DRP mode
- Source power to external peripherals when the board is powered through VIN
- Expose High Speed (480 Mbps) or Full Speed (12 Mbps) USB Host/Device interface
- Expose Displayport output interface
The Displayport interface is usable in conjunction with USB and can be either used with a simple cable adapter when the board is powered via VIN or with dongles able to provide power to the board while simultaneously outputting Displayport and USB. Such dongles usually provide an ethernet over USB port, a 2-port USB hub and a USB-C® port that can be used to provide power to the system.

## Real-Time Clock

The Real-Time clock allows for keeping the time of day with very low power consumption.

## Power Tree

![](assets/x8PowerTree.svg)
Power management is mainly performed by the BD71847AMWV IC (U1).

## Board Operation

### Getting Started - IDE

If you want to program your Arduino® Portenta X8 while offline you need to install the Arduino® Desktop IDE **[1]** To connect the Arduino® Edge control to your computer, you’ll need a USB Type-C cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor

All Arduino® boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino® Cloud Editor **[2]**, by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino® Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud

All Arduino® IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino® IoT Cloud which allows you to Log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Sample Sketches

Sample sketches for the Arduino® Portenta X8 can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino® IDE or in the “Documentation” section of the Arduino Pro website **[4]**

### Online Resources

Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on ProjectHub **[5]**, the Arduino® Library Reference **[6]** and the online store **[7]** where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.

### Board Recovery

All Arduino boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB it is possible to enter bootloader mode by configuring DIP switches.

**Note: A compatible carrier board with DIP switches (e.g. Portenta Max Carrier, Portenta Hat Carrier, or Portenta Breakout) is required to enable bootloader mode. It cannot be enabled with the Portenta X8 alone.**

## Mechanical Information

### Mounting Holes and Board Outline

The Portenta X8 is a double-sided 66.04 mm x 25.40 mm board with a USB-C® port overhanging the top edge and two High-Density connectors on the bottom side of the board. The onboard wireless antenna connector is located on the bottom edge of the board. The board has four 2.25 mm drilled mounting holes to provide for mechanical fixing.
