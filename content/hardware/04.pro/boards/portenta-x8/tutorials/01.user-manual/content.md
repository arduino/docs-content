## Portenta X8 with Arduino Cloud

***Note: this is an optional step. The Portenta X8 can also be used with locally without an internet connection.***

Making Portenta X8 compatible with Arduino Cloud means opening many new applications. This compatibility is guaranteed by a brand-new Python container, which includes a dedicated [Arduino IoT Cloud Python library](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-iot-cloud-py). Through Arduino Cloud APIs, the Python container ensures full interaction and simple porting of any Python developed application in the Arduino Cloud.

***Check all the available Arduino Cloud plans [here](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans#business) and create your Arduino Cloud account in a couple of steps (see the dedicated documentation at [this link](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/)).***

With the Arduino Linux Wizard experience, your Portenta X8 can be securely self-provisioned in Arduino Cloud; you need to create API keys, and the Python container running on X8 will do the rest. When provisioned, you can start directly interacting with an example Thing and Dashboard that will be automatically generated to guide you in this new journey.

Click the **Arduino Cloud** button to start provisioning your Portenta X8 in Arduino Cloud.

![Arduino Linux Wizard Arduino Cloud](assets/OOTB_homepage_cloud.png "Arduino Linux Wizard Arduino Cloud")

***If you want to learn more about Portenta X8 Manager features, check the dedicated section of this user manual called [Working with Portenta X8 Board Manager](#working-with-portenta-x8-board-manager).***

## Working with Linux

It is time to start interacting with the Linux OS embedded in your Portenta X8. To do that, you need to open your terminal window and look for [**ADB**](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) inside the directory **Arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/adb/32.0.0**. The Arduino15 folder may have a different location depending on your Operating System. Check [this article](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360018448279-Open-the-Arduino15-folder) to learn where your Arduino15 folder is located.

Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a tool included in the SDK software (Software Development Kit) and used, among other things, to make an Android device and a computer communicate. To check if ADB is working correctly, you can type `adb devices`. Your Portenta X8 will be listed there.

![Connection with ADB](assets/adb-connection.png "Connection with ADB")

***If you need to install ADB, you can also download the right tool for your Operating System directly from the [official Android website](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).***

If you want to start the embedded Arduino Linux Wizard from the command line, you can continue typing in your terminal:

```bash
adb forward tcp:8080 tcp:80
```

With this command, ADB allows you to forward the requests of your computer's `8080 TCP-IP port` to the `80 TCP-IP port` of your device, which, in this case, is the device with the name *Portenta X8*.

![ADB forward command](assets/adb-tcp-port.png "ADB forward command")

Now you can open your browser, go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and the same Arduino Linux Wizard dashboard will appear to allow you to configure your Portenta X8.

![Arduino Linux Wizard Homepage](assets/OOTB_homepage.png "Arduino Linux Wizard Homepage")

Now, you can type `adb shell` to start communicating with your Portenta X8.

![ADB shell command](assets/adb-shell-command.png "ADB shell command")

As it is a Linux device, you can create files, change directories, etc.

To gain admin (root) access, type `sudo su -`. The terminal prefix should turn red.

![ADB shell with admin access](assets/adb-sudo-su.png "ADB shell with admin access")

You can now freely program your Portenta X8 Linux OS. In the sections below, you can check out some basic commands to get started.

### Manage Your Network Via CLI

To connect to a Wi-Fi® Access Point via CLI, you can use the network manager tool **nmcli**. These are some of the most used commands:

* `nmcli device wifi connect <SSID> password <PASSWORD>` to connect to a specific SSID
* `nmcli de` to check the connection status
* `nmcli connection show` to visualize the active network interfaces (and their types) on your Portenta X8

### Accessing Over SSH Session

Establishing communication with the Portenta X8 via an SSH session is possible. To do so, a network connection is needed, either over Wi-Fi® , cellular or Ethernet. Using a device with DHCP server capabilities, such as a network router, is recommended for Ethernet connections. After setting up the network connection and DHCP, the Portenta X8 will be ready for SSH communication.

For Windows users, it is necessary to install a service tool to ease the following procedures. While Bonjour, Apple's implementation of zero-configuration networking, comes built into macOS, it is not natively included in Windows and must be installed separately.

***Before proceeding on __Windows__, please install [Bonjour Print Services for Windows](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US) before continuing the following steps.***

For macOS and Linux users, *Bonjour* is pre-installed on macOS, and *Avahi-Browse* is typically available on Linux by default. Thus, additional installation steps may be unnecessary for these operating systems.

In the subsequent sections, we will first walk you through the process on Windows, followed by details and instructions for Linux and macOS.

#### Using the Terminal

![SSH Services Availability Discovery](assets/ssh-x8-dns-sd-service.png "SSH Services Availability Discovery")

The command below is used to browse for SSH services on the local network that are advertised over a multicast Domain Name System (mDNS). This protocol resolves hostnames to IP addresses within small networks without a local name server.

```bash
dns-sd -B _sftp-ssh._tcp local
```

By executing this command, you can discover devices offering _SFTP services_ (file transfer over SSH) without prior knowledge of their IP addresses or hostnames.

The command lists these services, indicating where an SSH connection can be established for secure file transfers or shell access, helping to ease the identification and utilization of networked devices that support this protocol.

![Network Query for IPv4 and IPv6](assets/ssh-x8-dns-sd-v4v6.png "Network Query for IPv4 and IPv6")

```bash
dns-sd -G v4v6 portenta-x8-<UUID>.local
```

The command above queries the network for the _IPv4_ and _IPv6_ addresses associated with the hostname `portenta-x8-<UUID>.local`. The _UUID_ can be found within the instance name listed previously or if you have accessed the Portenta X8 via an ADB shell. An example command would look as follows:

```bash
dns-sd -G v4v6 portenta-x8-1822aa09dab6fad9.local
```

This command is handy for finding the IP addresses of devices such as the Portenta X8 that a DHCP server may assign dynamic IP addresses. It simplifies connecting to such devices over the network by providing their current IP addresses.

![Device Ping Test](assets/ssh-x8-dns-sd-ping.png "Device Ping Test")

The following command sends echo requests to the device with the hostname `portenta-x8-<UUID>.local` to check its network availability and measure round-trip time.

```bash
ping portenta-x8-<UUID>.local
```

This command helps verify that the Portenta X8 is online and reachable over the network and for diagnosing connectivity issues. The UUID can be ascertained by referring to the findings from an earlier SSH services scan with network query or the ADB shell.

![Portenta X8 Communication over SSH Session](assets/ssh-x8-session.png "Portenta X8 Communication over SSH Session")

After verifying that the Portenta X8 is accessible using a simple ping test, it is now possible to start an SSH session using the following command:

```bash
ssh fio@portenta-x8-1822aa09dab6fad9.local
```

The example command above starts an SSH (Secure Shell) connection to the Portenta X8 with the hostname `portenta-x8-1822aa09dab6fad9.local` using the username `fio`. The command format should be as follows:

```bash
ssh fio@portenta-x8-<UUID>.local
```

When executing the command, substitute the `<UUID>` placeholder with the actual UUID of the Portenta X8 you are attempting to connect to. You can confirm this UUID by checking the results of a prior SSH services scan with a network query or ADB shell.

If the device is configured correctly to accept SSH connections and the *`fio`* account exists with SSH access, this command will prompt for the password associated with the *`fio`* user.

Upon successful authentication, it will open a secure shell session to the device, allowing for command-line interface access and the execution of commands remotely on the Portenta X8.

The password and the rest of the configuration for using the Portenta X8 inside the shell remain the same.

The process is similar for *GNU/Linux* and *macOS*, with minor differences in the initial steps when browsing for SSH services on the local network.

- **For GNU/Linux**:

Use *Avahi-Browse* to search for SSH services on the local network:

```bash
avahi-browse -d local _sftp-ssh._tcp --resolve -t
```

- **macOS**:

On macOS, you can use the similar command:

```bash
dns-sd -B _sftp-ssh._tcp local
```

Alternatively, you can use a software called *Discovery*, which is available [here](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/discovery-dns-sd-browser/id1381004916?l=en&mt=12).

#### Using Software With GUI

The SSH session can be initialized using third-party software with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy access. An example is a software called *Bonjour Browser*, which can be downloaded [here](https://hobbyistsoftware.com/bonjourbrowser).

![SSH Services Availability Discovery with GUI](assets/ssh-x8-bonjour.png "SSH Services Availability Discovery with GUI")

This software simplifies browsing SSH services on the local network advertised over mDNS using a GUI. The image above, for example, shows all available services on the network, including those for the Portenta X8. You can retrieve the IP address information by simply clicking on a service item.

Once the information is verified, you can use that data with software such as [*PuTTY*](https://www.putty.org/). *PuTTY* is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console, and network file transfer application. It supports several network protocols, including *SSH (Secure Shell)* and *SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)*.

![Portenta X8 SSH Session with PuTTY - Setup](assets/ssh-x8-putty.png "Portenta X8 SSH Session with PuTTY - Setup")

In the PuTTY Configuration window, keeping the default values, you must specify the _Host Name (or IP address)_ field with `portenta-x8-<UUID>`. For instance, you would use:

```
portenta-x8-1822aa09dab6fad9
```

Click on `Open`, and it will prompt a security alert. It displays information about the connection, including fingerprint details. Depending on your connection profile preference, you can choose to `Accept` or `Connect Once`.

![Portenta X8 SSH Session with PuTTY - Authentication](assets/ssh-x8-putty-auth.png "Portenta X8 SSH Session with PuTTY - Authentication")

After verifying the security alert and proceeding, you have an SSH session that has begun communicating with the Portenta X8.

![Portenta X8 SSH Session with PuTTY](assets/ssh-x8-putty-session.png "Portenta X8 SSH Session with PuTTY")

### Inspect Real-Time Tasks And Logs Via CLI

Run `journalctl -f` to check the status of active services and possibly their errors, as well as various system event logs.

![ADB shell journalctl package](assets/adb-shell-real-time-tasks.png "ADB shell journalctl package")

By calling `journalctl`, it is possible to look at the log of all the running activities by specifying the type of log you are looking for. Some logs may be a warning that can be ignored, while some may be critical errors. Type `journalctl -p 0` to view emergency system messages; otherwise, change the number 0 with the error code you want to investigate according to the following error code numbers:

| **Error code** | **Meaning** |
|----------------|-------------|
| 0              | Emergency   |
| 1              | Alerts      |
| 2              | Critical    |
| 3              | Errors      |
| 4              | Warning     |
| 5              | Notice      |
| 6              | Info        |
| 7              | Debug       |

When you specify the error code, it shows all messages from that code and above. For example, if you specify error code 2, it shows all messages with priority 2, 1 and 0.

You can also view logs for a specific time and date duration. You can use the `-- since` switch with a combination of `"yesterday"`, `"now"`, or a specific date and time `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`.

An example of how to use the command:

```bash
journalctl --since "2022-12-22 12:20:00" --until yesterday
```

### Working with Docker on Portenta X8

To customize the Portenta X8, you can develop and deploy Docker containers. Start by ensuring Docker is correctly set up on your device. A quick way to test Docker functionality is by running the official `Hello World` container from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

First, pull the image using the following command:

```bash
docker pull hello-world
```

Then, run the container:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This simple process pulls and runs the `Hello World` container, verifying that Docker is available and functional on your Portenta X8. The following clip shows running the `Hello World` container briefly:

![Hello World container on the Portenta X8](assets/docker-run-example.gif)

With this, you can start customizing the Portenta X8 by creating and deploying containers tailored to your needs. For example, you can develop Python applications or other utilities and package them into Docker containers for deployment.

***You can explore [__Arduino's Docker Hub__](https://hub.docker.com/u/arduino) for a repository of preconfigured Docker images designed to simplify development on the Portenta X8.***

#### Build Your Container

You can create your custom containers and build them inside the Portenta X8. Since Portenta X8 is based on an *arm64 architecture*, you can use the command `build` only if you build the container directly on an *arm64 architecture* (e.g., Macbook based on M1/M2 processor or Portenta X8). Open a terminal window and type:

```bash
docker build . -t x8-custom-devel
```

Otherwise, if you are using a different architecture or building machine, use the `buildx` command to specify which architecture your build should compile for:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t x8-custom-devel --load .
```

This way, your Docker image will be built and tagged with the name `x8-custom-devel`.

It is time for you to deploy the newly created Docker image. To do so, save it somewhere and deploy it on your Portenta X8.

#### Managing Early Start Services When Building Custom Containers

The Portenta X8 firmware includes the **`compose-apps-early-start.service`**, which starts certain Docker Compose applications early during the boot process. This feature helps pre-configured services run smoothly but may sometimes interfere with custom containers you pull or build.

For example, system tools like [**Skopeo**](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-skopeo) may automatically remove containers without warning. This can happen to containers pulled from external sources or locally built on the device. If you notice that your custom containers are being removed unexpectedly, you can solve this by managing the system services with a few command lines.

To prevent automatic container removal and ensure your custom containers stay intact, the early start services can be stopped and disabled by running the following commands in the ADB shell:

```bash
systemctl stop compose-apps-early-start.service
systemctl stop compose-apps-early-start-recovery.service
systemctl disable compose-apps-early-start.service
systemctl disable compose-apps-early-start-recovery.service
```

Alternatively, you can use this single line of command:

```bash
systemctl stop compose-apps-early-start.service && systemctl stop compose-apps-early-start-recovery.service && systemctl disable compose-apps-early-start.service && systemctl disable compose-apps-early-start-recovery.service
```

Stopping and disabling these services will prevent the early start of compose applications, ensuring your custom containers are not removed automatically. Additionally, make sure to check for the [*latest firmware image*](https://downloads.arduino.cc/portentax8image/image-latest.tar.gz) to maintain compatibility and optimal performance of the Portenta X8 with custom container developments.

#### Deploy Your Container With Docker Hub

If you have a [Docker Hub account](https://hub.docker.com/), you can freely upload your Docker image to your registry (e.g., `yourhubusername`):

```bash
docker push yourhubusername/x8-custom-devel
```

Your image is now available in your Docker Hub registry `yourhubusername`.

At this point, you can directly pull the image to your Portenta X8. To do so, connect to your Portenta X8 through ADB. It can be found at `Arduino15\packages\arduino\tools\adb\32.0.0`.

You can pull the image from that directory to the preferred location.

```bash
adb shell
```

With the Portenta X8's terminal, the following command is used.

```bash
docker pull x8-custom-devel
```

Now, your image is correctly deployed on your Portenta X8.

#### Deploy Your Container Without Docker Hub

If you do not have a Docker Hub account, you can also save the Docker container locally as a **.tar** file. Then, you can easily load that to an image.

You can use the 'docker save' command to save a Docker image after you have built it. For example, let's save a local copy of the `x8-custom-devel` docker image you made:

```bash
docker save x8-custom-devel:latest | gzip > x8-custom-devel_latest.tar.gz
```

At this point, you can directly pull the image to your Portenta X8. To do so, connect to your Portenta X8 through ADB. It can be found at `Arduino15\packages\arduino\tools\adb\32.0.0`.

```bash
docker import /home/fio/x8-custom-devel_latest.tar.gz x8-custom-devel:latest
```

Now, your image is correctly deployed on your Portenta X8.

#### Launch Your Container

To launch your brand new image, you need to create a new `docker-compose.yml`. To do so, first, you must stop the current `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
cd /var/sota/compose-apps/arduino-ootb && docker compose stop
```

You can now create the path for the new `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
mkdir /var/sota/compose-apps/custom-devel && cd /var/sota/compose-apps/custom-devel && touch docker-compose.yml
```

Before uploading, open the `docker-compose.yml` and edit it as follows to make it use the Docker image you have just created:

```
services:
 custom:
  container_name: custom-devel
  hostname: "portenta-x8"
  image: x8-custom-devel:latest
      
  restart: unless-stopped
  tty: true
  read_only: false
  user: "0"
  volumes:
    #- '/dev:/dev'
    - '/run/arduino_hw_info.env:/run/arduino_hw_info.env:ro'
    - '/sys/devices:/sys/devices'
    - '/sys/class/pwm:/sys/class/pwm'
    - '/sys/bus/iio:/sys/bus/iio'
    - '/var/sota:/var/sota'
    - './keys:/tmp/keys:ro'
  devices:
    - '/dev/gpiochip5'
    - '/dev/tee0'
```

It is now time to upload the new `docker-compose.yml` to your Portenta X8:

```bash
docker compose up --detach
```

And you are ready to go! Your Portenta X8 Dashboards and Things can be customized using the same process multiple times.

***If you are using the Portenta X8 Manager, go to [this documentation](https://docs.foundries.io/latest/tutorials/getting-started-with-docker/getting-started-with-docker.html) to learn how to upload the newly created container in your FoundriesFactory.***

#### In-Depth Docker Container Management On Portenta X8

We created dedicated tutorials covering this topic. Go check them out:

***Learn more on how to output WebGL content on a screen with Portenta X8 by checking the [dedicated tutorial](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-x8/display-output-webgl).***

### Build A Custom Image For Portenta X8

You may want to build a custom image for the Portenta X8 with the source code provided in the public [GitHub repository of lmp-manifest](https://github.com/arduino/lmp-manifest/). Building an image locally can help debug certain aspects of the system, such as the bootloader or kernel support.

***Have a look at [this dedicated tutorial](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-x8/image-building) to understand how to build your own custom image.***

### Using the Integrated Overlay Configurator

**tenta-config** is a configuration tool for managing hardware settings and device tree overlays on compatible carriers. It provides a graphical interface for customizing system configurations with compatible carriers, such as peripheral management, adjusting video output settings, and managing pin mappings.

![Portenta X8 tenta-config Main Screen](assets/tenta-config-main.png)

The image above shows the main window when accessing the `tenta-config`. It lists all compatible carriers, the option to automatically probe the attached carriers, and additional operations for debugging and configuring purposes for the Portneta X8.

This tool simplifies hardware customization, allowing users to modify their setup without modifying the core device tree, which is essential for tasks like configuring display settings or activating specific hardware features.

To access the `tenta-config` window, please follow these instructions.

First, access the Docker container named **x8-devel** with the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it x8-devel sh
```

This command uses **docker exec** to start a new shell session inside the running **x8-devel** container. The `-it` flags provide an interactive terminal session for executing commands within the container. This is useful for development, enabling direct code editing, monitoring processes, or debugging in an isolated environment.

Next, search for the **tenta_runner** Python script by running:

```bash
find / -name *.py
```

This command recursively searches from the root directory for any Python script, helping locate utilities or applications spread across the system.

Once you find **tenta_runner.py**, navigate to its directory using:

```bash
cd /root/examples/tenta-config
```

Then run the script:

```bash
python tenta_runner.py
```

This command launches a GUI within the `tent` framework, opening the `tenta-config` window as seen in the image below:

![Portenta X8 tenta-config Main Screen](assets/tenta-config-main.png)

If you have a Pro 4G Module or a GIGA Display Shield with the Portenta Mid Carrier, you can choose the `Portenta Mid Carrier` option and set the necessary overlays to prepare essential environment configuration with a few steps.

You can find more information on how to use the `tanta-config` to set up the Pro 4G Module [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-mid-carrier/user-manual/#using-linux-4) and the GIGA Displaye Shield [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-mid-carrier/user-manual/#giga-display-shield-connector-j19).

### Additional Tutorials

If you want to continue working with your Portenta X8, you can find tons of additional tutorials in the **Tutorials** section of our [Arduino Docs](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/portenta-x8). Please go check them out!

## Working With Arduino

### Working With Arduino IDE

In this section, you will learn how to upload a sketch to the M4 core on the STM32H747XI MCU.

Open the Arduino IDE and download the latest **Arduino Mbed OS Portenta Boards Core** following [this tutorial](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-mbed_portenta). Then, select **Portenta X8** from the board selector.

![IDE Board Selector](assets/x8-IDE.png "IDE Board Selector")

Create a custom sketch or open an example like the blink sketch:

```arduino
void setup(){
 pinMode(LED_BUILTIN ,OUTPUT);
}

void loop(){
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN , HIGH);
 delay(1000);
 digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN , LOW);
 delay(1000);
}
```

Select the device port and press **Compile and Upload**. The sketch is compiled into a binary, uploaded to the Linux side of the Portenta X8, and flashed by the RPC service running on Linux.

***Please refer to the [Communication Between Arduino and Linux](#communication-between-arduino-and-linux) section for details on how Remote Procedure Call enables this communication.***

Once the upload is successful, the onboard LED of your Portenta X8 will blink at a one second interval.

If you prefer to upload the firmware manually, first compile the sketch by selecting **Export compiled binary** from the Sketch menu in the Arduino IDE. It will compile the sketch and save the binary file in the sketch folder. Alternatively, you can use the [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.29/) to create an `elf` file.

You can use the ADB tool installed as part of the Portenta X8 core to upload the firmware. It can be found at `Arduino15\packages\arduino\tools\adb\32.0.0`.

From that directory, you can use the `adb` tool. To upload your compiled sketch, you need to type the following command into your terminal window:

```bash
adb push <sketchBinaryPath> /tmp/arduino/m4-user-sketch.elf
```

![ADB upload with a terminal](assets/x8-terminal-ADB-push.png)

### Communication Between Arduino and Linux

The Portenta X8 uses **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** to exchange data between processors, allowing remote **procedures** or **functions** to run over a network while appearing as local calls.

In a client-server model, **RPC** supports distributed computing by treating **procedure calls** as client **requests** and **return values** as server **responses**. To ensure reliability, two semantics are used:

- **`At most once`**: Prevents duplicate execution if a failure occurs.
- **`At least once`**: Guarantees at least one execution, even if repeated.

The Portenta X8 relies on [**MessagePack-RPC**](https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc) for communication, supporting *OpenAMP*, *SPI*, *Linux Char Device*, and *TCP/IP*.

The **M7 core** of the **STM32H7** manages data flow between the Linux and Arduino environments, working as an intermediary when the **M4 core** runs an Arduino sketch. At the same time, `m4-proxy` eases data transfer on the Linux side. This design does not support traditional dual-core processing.

![Linux Arduino RPC](assets/linux_arduino_RPC.png "Linux Arduino RPC")

![RPC M4 proxy](assets/m4-proxy.png "RPC M4 proxy")

You can make interesting systems with the Arduino environment by leveraging the RPC communication between the Arduino and Linux layers. Check out this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed/tree/master/libraries/RPC/examples) for examples of using RPC with the Portenta X8.

***For further details about Remote Procedure Call and its implementation, please refer to [this dedicated tutorial](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-x8/python-arduino-data-exchange/).***

### Advanced Arduino-Linux Integration

Build Arduino sketches for real-time tasks like sensor communication and Fieldbus management. Then, send data to the cloud or remote servers using Linux's networking capabilities.

For example, the [Data Exchange Between Python® on Linux and an Arduino Sketch](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-x8/python-arduino-data-exchange) tutorial will help you understand how to exchange sensor data between the Python® container embedded on Portenta X8 and an Arduino sketch.

If you are a more advanced user, you can check [Multi-Protocol Gateway With Portenta X8 & Max Carrier](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-x8/multi-protocol-gateway) tutorial on developing your multi-protocol gateway. It aims to receive data from a sensor with the Arduino layer via MQTT protocol, take advantage of RPC to establish communication between Arduino and Linux, and then send the acquired data to *The Things Network* via *LoRaWAN®* managed by the Linux layer.

## Working With Portenta X8 Board Manager

The Portenta X8 Board Manager helps you keep your Portenta X8 Linux image and containers up to date, even remotely, using Over-The-Air (OTA) updates via wireless connectivity.

An **Arduino Cloud for Business** plan with a Portenta X8 Board Manager subscription is required to enable these features.

***__Using the Portenta X8 Board Manager is optional and not required for the Portenta X8 to function.__ It leverages Foundries.io's infrastructure to enable features like secure Over-The-Air (OTA) updates for the Portenta X8 OS and applications. __While it simplifies development and management processes, it is not a mandatory component__.***

**For more information on configuration and environment exploration, please refer to the [Portenta X8 Board Manager](#portenta-x8-board-manager) section at the beginning of the user manual.**

### Device And Fleet Management With Portenta X8 Board Manager

Verify that your Portenta X8 is correctly added to your FoundriesFactory by checking if it is listed among the available devices under the **Devices** section.

![FoundriesFactory device overview](assets/web_board_manager_factory_device-overview.png "FoundriesFactory device overview")

If you want to check if your Portenta X8 is updated according to the latest available Target (i.e., update), you can check the bulb's color under the status column. There are three main color options:

| **Bulb color** | **Meaning**                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Green          | Device online and updated      |
| Yellow         | Device online and not updated  |
| Red            | Device offline and not updated |

In this case, the Portenta X8 is connected to the network (and to the FoundriesFactory) but has not been updated.

You can see the Target uploaded on your device under the Target column, i.e., *portenta-x8-lmp-569*, and get additional information about what is included in this specific Target by clicking on it.

![FoundriesFactory device target specs](assets/web_board_manager_factory_device_specs.png "FoundriesFactory device target specs")

The above window also shows you all the container apps you have installed on your device, and you can start using them.

If you scroll down in the same window, you can also look at the update history of that specific device.

![FoundriesFactory device update history](assets/web_board_manager_factory_update_history.png "FoundriesFactory update history")

You can now compare the Target uploaded on your Portenta X8 with the Target available in the **Targets** section and decide whether to update your device.

![FoundriesFactory target overview](assets/web_board_manager_factory_target.png "FoundriesFactory target overview")

***Learn how to update your Portenta X8 with your FoundriesFactory by checking the [dedicated section](#portenta-x8-os-image-update) of this user manual.***

This **Target** page contains the Linux images built each time something is committed in the repositories available under the **Source** section. In this section, you can find the four repositories that are used to customize the images:

* **ci-scripts.git:** Scripts that define the platform and container build jobs on the FoundriesFactory system.
* **containers.git:** This is where containers and docker-compose apps are defined. It allows you to define which containers to build/deploy and how to orchestrate them on the platform.
* **lmp-manifest.git:** The repo manifest for the platform build. It defines which layer versions are included in the platform image. This includes [**meta-partner-arduino**](https://github.com/arduino/meta-partner-arduino/), the layer containing Arduino-specific customizations (machine definition, device drivers, etc.).
* **meta-subscriber-overrides.git:** *OE* layer that defines what is included in your FoundriesFactory image. You can add board-specific customizations and overrides or add and remove packages provided in the default Linux microPlatform.

Committing to **lmp-manifest.git** or **meta-subscriber-overrides.git** repositories will create a platform Target, i.e. base Linux platform image. On the other hand, committing to **containers.git** will create a container Target, including all the containers and docker-compose apps you would like to upload on your Portenta X8.

Both these Targets will generate the artifacts specified in the **ci-scripts.git**, which includes all the required files to program the Target in case of platform build.  

### RBAC With Portenta X8 Board Manager

You do not have to be the only one in your organization with permission to update your Portenta X8 devices. The FoundriesFactory integrates a Role-Based-Access-Control functionality (RBAC) to allow users to add multiple teams with multiple members each.

You can start defining a new team by clicking the **Teams** section.

![FoundriesFactory Teams](assets/web_board_manager_team.png "FoundriesFactory Teams")

The level of access and specific permissions are defined by the team’s role in the FoundriesFactory. As you can notice from the image below, multiple roles and permissions are available.

You can type the email addresses of your teammates, and they will receive an automatic email with the invitation to join the corresponding team in your FoundriesFactory.

### FoundriesFactory FIOCTL

The FoundriesFactory includes a command line tool called [FIOCTL](https://docs.foundries.io/latest/getting-started/install-fioctl/index.html), which allows you to manage your Portenta X8 through your CLI.

With this tool, you can easily upload containers to a board linked to your FoundriesFactory just by stating the FoundriesFactory name, the board name, and the app you would like to upload.

***Learn how to use this tool by checking the dedicated tutorial at [this link](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-x8/custom-container) or the corresponding [Foundries documentation](https://docs.foundries.io/latest/getting-started/install-fioctl/index.html).***

## Pins

In order to learn how to properly call GPIOs or other peripherals both in the Arduino environment or in Linux, with or without a carrier, you can check the following pinout diagrams:

## Communication

In this section, you will learn how to make your Portenta X8 communicate with multiple types of sensors or other external devices, leveraging the wide variety of supported interfaces:

* [SPI](#spi)
* [I2C](#i2c)
* [UART](#uart)
* [Bluetooth®](#bluetooth)

### SPI

In this case, a Portenta X8 with a Portenta Breakout board is used to connect an external SPI device.

#### SPI With Linux

You need to enable SPI support before using SPI devices.

Open Portenta X8 Shell as explained [here](#working-with-linux).

With root privileges on the Portenta X8, you can enable the SPI device interface by loading the `spidev` module using the following command:

```bash
sudo modprobe spidev
```

To ensure the `spidev` module loads automatically at startup, add it to the system's module configuration and reboot:

```bash
echo "spidev" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/spidev.conf
sudo systemctl reboot
```

To set up a service named `my_spi_service` that utilizes the SPI device at `/dev/spidev0.0`, include the following configuration in your service definition:

```yaml
services:
  my_spi_service:
    devices:
      - "/dev/spidev0.0"
```

This configuration is typically added to a _docker-compose.yml_ file, allowing the service to interact with the specified SPI device.

If the Linux user on which the container is running is not `root`, you need to set up the permissions for the user to access the SPI devices. You might add the required comments to an `entrypoint.sh` shell file (to be added to the `Dockerfile` or the `docker-compose.yml` file).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

# entrypoint.sh example

chgrp users /dev/spi-*
chmod g+rw /dev/spi-*
usermod -aG users <container user>

# Possible command to execute your application as a non-privileged user with gosu
# Check https://github.com/tianon/gosu for more information
gosu <container user> /usr/bin/python my_spi_service.py
```

#### SPI Port Mapping

| Linux | Arduino Portenta Breakout |
|-------|---------------------------|
| 134   | **`SPI1 CK`**             |
| 135   | **`SPI1 COPI`**           |
| 136   | **`SPI1 CIPO`**           |
| 137   | **`SPI1 CS`**             |

#### SPI With Arduino

The `SPI` object is [mapped](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed/blob/23e4a5ff8e9c16bece4f0e810acc9760d3dd4462/variants/PORTENTA_X8/pins_arduino.h#L85) as follows on the Portenta Breakout Board and can be deployed as usual:

| **SPI Pin** | **Arduino Portenta Breakout** |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| CIPO        | Pin 0 (Header GPIO0)          |
| COPI        | Pin A6 (Header Analog)        |
| SCK         | Pin A5 (Header Analog)        |
| CS          | Pin 1 (Header GPIO0)          |

### I2C

In this case, a Portenta X8 with a Portenta Breakout board is used to connect an external I2C device.

#### I2C With Linux

You need to enable I2C support before using I2C devices.

Open Portenta X8 Shell as explained [here](#working-with-linux).

With administrative (root) privileges on the Portenta X8, you can enable the I2C device interface using the following command:

```bash
sudo modprobe i2c-dev
```

Use the following commands to ensure the `i2c-dev` module is automatically loaded at system startup. A system reboot is required for the changes to take effect:

```bash
echo "i2c-dev" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/i2c-dev.conf
```

```bash
sudo systemctl reboot
```

These commands activate and configure the I2C device interface on the system. The following section demonstrates how to set up I2C services within a Docker environment by defining them under `my_i2c_service` in a _docker-compose.yml_ file:

```yaml
services:
  my_i2c_service:
    devices:
      - "/dev/i2c-0"
      - "/dev/i2c-1"
      - "/dev/i2c-2"
      - "/dev/i2c-3"
```

You can configure I2C services for all available interfaces (from 0 to 3) or specify particular services as needed.

If the Linux user on which the container is running is not `root`, you need to set up the permissions for the user to access the I2C devices. You might add the required comments to an `entrypoint.sh` shell file (to be added to the `Dockerfile` or the `docker-compose.yml` file).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

# entrypoint.sh example

chgrp users /dev/i2c-*
chmod g+rw /dev/i2c-*
usermod -aG users <container user>

# Possible command to execute your application as a non-privileged user with gosu
# Check https://github.com/tianon/gosu for more information
gosu <container user> /usr/bin/python my_i2c_service.py
```

#### I2C Port Mappings

| **Linux**    | **Arduino Portenta Breakout** | **Notes**   |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `/dev/i2c-1` | **`I2C1`**                    |             |
| `/dev/i2c-2` | **`I2C0`**                    | Recommended |
| `/dev/i2c-3` | **`I2C2`**                    |             |

#### Examples

Within the Portenta X8 shell, you can quickly test I2C communication with compatible devices using specific commands. To list all connected I2C devices, use:

```bash
i2cdetect -y <I2C bus>
```

To interact with a specific I2C device and retrieve data, the command format is:

```bash
i2cget -y <I2C bus> <device address> <register address>
```

For example:

```bash
# List I2C devices on bus 2
i2cdetect -y 2

# Read data from a device at address 0x77 on bus 2, register 0xD0
i2cget -y 2 0x77 0xD0
```

If a BME280 sensor is connected to *I2C0* and the above commands are used, the Portenta X8 will show **`0x60`** value to tell the sensor is alive.

Here are some simple examples of implementing I2C communication on the Portenta X8 with Portenta Mid Carrier using Python.

The following code uses the SMBus (System Management Bus) protocol, with SMBus-compatible [libraries](https://github.com/kplindegaard/smbus2), to read a data byte from a device on `/dev/i2c-3`. The byte is read from address 80, offset 0, and then printed.

Examples of using SMBus-compatible [libraries](https://github.com/kplindegaard/smbus2):

```python
from smbus2 import SMBus

# Connect to /dev/i2c-3
bus = SMBus(3)
b = bus.read_byte_data(80, 0)
print(b)
```

The next example shows how to initialize the I2C bus using the _smbus2_ library and read multiple bytes from a device. The `read_i2c_block_data` function retrieves a block of bytes from the I2C device at the specified address.

```python
from smbus2 import SMBus

# Initialize the I2C bus
bus = SMBus(3)  # 3 represents /dev/i2c-3

device_address = 0x1
num_bytes = 2

# Read from the I2C device
data = bus.read_i2c_block_data(device_address, 0, num_bytes)  # Starting address is 0 to read from

# Data is a list of bytes
for byte in data:
    print(byte)
```

The following example shows how to write data to an I2C device using the _smbus2_ library. A data byte (`value`) is sent to a specific address (`device_address`) with a given instruction.

```python
from smbus2 import SMBus

# Initialize the I2C bus
bus = SMBus(3)  # 3 represents /dev/i2c-3

device_address = 0x1
instruction = 0x00
value = 0xFF

# Write to the I2C device
bus.write_byte_data(device_address, instruction, value)
```

In the following example, the [python-periphery](https://python-periphery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library is used to communicate with the I2C device. This library integrates a broad range of protocols within the same script. The `I2C.transfer()` method performs read and write operations on the I2C bus.

The code reads a byte from an EEPROM at address `0x50`, offsets `0x100`, and then prints it.

```python
from periphery import I2C

# Open i2c-3 controller
i2c = I2C("/dev/i2c-3")

# Read byte at address 0x100 of EEPROM at 0x50
msgs = [I2C.Message([0x01, 0x00]), I2C.Message([0x00], read=True)]
i2c.transfer(0x50, msgs)
print("0x100: 0x{:02x}".format(msgs[1].data[0]))

i2c.close()
```

#### I2C With Arduino

The `Wire` object is [mapped](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed/blob/23e4a5ff8e9c16bece4f0e810acc9760d3dd4462/variants/PORTENTA_X8/pins_arduino.h#L113) to pins `PWM6` (I2C `SCL`) and `PWM8` (I2C `SDA`) on the Portenta Breakout Board and can be deployed as usual.

Since one of the `I2C` pins is GPIO-multiplexed, you need to detach it from the other GPIO. Just add the following line to the `setup()` definition to make it fully functional for `I2C` operations.

 ```arduino
 void setup() {
  pinMode(PA_12, INPUT);
 }    
 ```
 
### UART

In this case, a Portenta X8 with a Portenta Breakout board can be used to explore UART communication. The Portenta Mid Carrier and Portenta Hat Carrier also provides the capability to use the UART communication.

#### UART With Linux

A standard UART is available as `/dev/ttymxc1` in Linux and is mapped to the **`UART1`** port on the Portenta Breakout.

With root access on the Portenta X8, you can list the available serial ports in Linux using the following command:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM* /dev/ttymxc*

// Example output:
/dev/ttyUSB0   /dev/ttyUSB2   /dev/ttymxc1   /dev/ttymxc3
/dev/ttyUSB1   /dev/ttyUSB3   /dev/ttymxc2
```

Common serial devices are typically labeled as _/dev/ttyUSBx_, _/dev/ttyACMx_, or _/dev/ttymxcx_. For instance, you might see _/dev/ttymxc1_ listed.

The following Python script uses the _pyserial_ library for UART communication. The _processData_ function is defined to handle incoming data, which can be customized according to your needs.

```python
import serial
import time

# Define the processData function (customize based on your requirements)
def processData(data):
    print("Received:", data)  # Currently, it just prints the data. Modify as needed.

# Set up the serial port
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttymxc1', 9600)  # Replace with the correct port and baud rate for your setup

incoming = ""

while True:
    # Check for available data and read individual characters
    while ser.in_waiting:
        c = ser.read().decode('utf-8')  # Read a single character and decode from bytes to string

        # Check if the character is a newline (line-ending)
        if c == '\n':
            # Process the received data
            processData(incoming)

            # Clear the incoming data string for the next message
            incoming = ""
        else:
            # Add the character to the incoming data string
            incoming += c

        time.sleep(0.002)  # Delay for data buffering, similar to Arduino's delay(2);
```

This script maintains a serial connection on _/dev/ttymxc1_ with a baud rate of _9600_. It reads incoming data character by character until it encounters a newline (`\n`), which indicates the end of a data packet.

After processing the data, the script resets and is ready for the next message. The `time.sleep(0.002)` introduces a brief delay for data buffering, similar to `delay(2);` in the Arduino environment.

### Bluetooth®

Portenta X8 supports Bluetooth® connectivity just on the Linux side.

In order to communicate with Bluetooth® devices via the Portenta X8 Shell, you can use the Bluetooth® utility **bluetoothctl**. These are some of the most used commands:

* `bluetoothctl devices` to list all the available Bluetooth® devices
* `bluetoothctl pair [mac_address]` to pair with a specific device through its MAC address
* `bluetoothctl connect [mac_address]` to connect to a paired device
* `bluetoothctl disconnect [mac_address]` to disconnect from a paired device
