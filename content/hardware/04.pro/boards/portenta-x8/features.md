<FeatureDescription>

The Portenta X8 is a high-performance board, with many exceptional features. With two microprocessors combined, the NXP® i.MX 8M Mini MPU (Linux) and STM32H747XI dual Cortex®-M7+M4 32bit low power ARM® MCU (Arduino), this board is a great source to power the upcoming generation of the Industrial Internet of Things.  

Thanks to the use of containers, the Portenta X8 offers an easy and secure way to implement applications running in a controlled environment. The user has full control of the containers that the board is executing, having the option of creating and running custom containers on its own without the requirement of any additional subscription services and totally free of charge.  

In case the user needs a more advanced and scalable professional solution, Arduino has created, in collaboration with Foundries, a subscription service designed for professional solutions with many advanced features like updates Over-The-Air and full control of the containers and management of multiple boards.

<FeatureList>
  <Feature title="NXP® i.MX 8M Mini" image="core">
    Includes the powerful NXP® i.MX 8M Mini processor with 4x ARM® Cortex®-A53 core platforms up to 1.8GHz per core and 1x Cortex-M4 core up to 400MHz.

  </Feature>

  <Feature title="STM32H747XI dual Cortex®-M7+M4 32bit low power Arm® MCU" image="mcu">
    X8's integrated microcontroller is the dual-core STM32H747 including a Cortex® M7 running at 480 MHz and a Cortex® M4 running at 240 MHz. The M4 core is available for real-time control of motors and other time-critical machinery at a barebones level. The M7 core acts as a mediator between the peripherals and the i.MX 8M Mini and runs a proprietary firmware inaccessible to the User.

  <Feature title="Two industrial-grade products in one" image="communication">
    The X8 offers the best of two approaches: the flexibility of usage of Linux combined with real-time applications. This approach allows developers to leverage the Arduino environment to perform e.g. automation control while accomplishing high-performance processes on Linux cores at the same time. 
  </Feature>

  <Feature title="Containerizing system" image="configurability">
    With the so called encapsulated application, developers can isolate a single package of software, which means that the applications can run within a controlled environment. This allows developers to design device-independent software while achieving modularization, thanks to the container composition.
