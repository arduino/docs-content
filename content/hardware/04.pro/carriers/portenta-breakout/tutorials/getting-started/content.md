## Instructions

### 1. Get to Know the Carrier
The Portenta Breakout is designed to reduce development time. It gives access to the Portenta's High Density connectors as well as features Ethernet, USB-A, a JTAG connector and more. However, for this tutorial, we will focus on using the **Arduino_PortentaBreakout** library to get access to the High Density connectors and create some simple example use cases.

### 2. The Basic Setup
As part of this tutorial, we will create two sample use cases for the **Arduino_PortentaBreakout** library: starting by using the Portenta Breakout's PWM pins to connect an LED and fade its brightness high ad low. Secondly, we will connect an external potentiometer to showcase how to use the Portenta Breakout to read an analog input. In order to use the pins on the Portenta Breakout to connect external components, pin headers have to be soldered on to the used pins. We recommend using double row pin headers.

After having prepared the Portenta Breakout by soldering on pin headers, we can start using it. The board comes with two DIP switches called **BOOT** and **BT_SEL**. These switches are used to keep the Portenta in either boot-mode (BT_SEL switch) or to enable the embedded bootloader (BOOT switch) to upload firmware via the USB port on the Portenta Breakout. In this case, we have to make sure that both DIP switches are set in the **OFF** position. Having done that, we can connect the Portenta H7 to the Portenta Breakout using the two high density connectors in the orientation showcased by the dashed line on the Portenta Breakout.

### 3. The Circuit
In order to build this example circuit, we need our Portenta Breakout with the Portenta H7 on top and headers soldered on (at least within the ANALOG/PWM and GPIO section on the bottom right corner of the carrier). Then we need a simple LED, an adequate resistor for it (we are using a 220Ω resistor) as well as a potentiometer. To connect all these components we use jumper wires and a breadboard by following this schematics:

![Connecting the LEDs and the Portenta](assets/breakout_gs_circuit_diagram.svg) 

For the LED we can use any of the Portenta Breakout's 10 PWM Pins, in this case **PWM 9**. For the potentiometer, on the other hand, we can use one of the analog pins (A0 to A7) in order to read the potentiometer current value, in this example we use **A7**. The potentiometer also needs a 3.3V power source, which we take from the GPIO section on the Portenta Breakout, considering it being located most conveniently and close by. Eventually, potentiometer and LED have to be connected to GND to finalize the circuit. 

After having connected everything, the Portenta H7 can be plugged into the computer using a USB-C® cable and we can start with the code.

### 4. The Arduino_PortentaBreakout Library
In the Arduino IDE we create a new Sketch and make sure we have selected the Arduino Portenta H7 on the M7 core. If you haven't used the Portenta H7 before, [here](/tutorials/portenta-h7/setting-up-portenta) you can find a detailed tutorial on how to get started with it. 

In order to use the pins on the Portenta Breakout we need to install the **Arduino_PortentaBreakout** Library, which allows us to address all the pins located on the Carrier. Therefore, we need to download the library using the library manager, by going to **Sketch > Include Libraries > Manage Libraries** and search for **Arduino_PortentaBreakout**.

Once we have installed the Portenta Breakout library, we can import it to our Sketch.

```cpp
#include <Arduino_PortentaBreakout.h>
```

The library defines a number of constants that can be used to call desired pins, so are PWM pins for example called `PWM0`, `PWM1`, etc and analog pins are named `ANALOG_A0`, `ANALOG_A1`, etc. A complete list with all keywords can be found below in the "Next Steps" section.

We can now create a variable of the type `breakoutPin` and thereby specify the name of the pin we would like to use. This can either be a specific pin or we can use an array to save a selection of pins that we can then use throughout our sketch.

```cpp
breakoutPin pwmPins[] = {PWM0, PWM1, PWM2, PWM3, PWM4 , PWM5, PWM6 , PWM7, PWM8, PWM9};
breakoutPin analogPins[] = {ANALOG_A0, ANALOG_A1, ANALOG_A2, ANALOG_A3, ANALOG_A4, ANALOG_A5, ANALOG_A6, ANALOG_A7};
```

### 5. PWM & LED
Once we have the pins in place, we can start controlling the LED we connected to `PWM9` by creating a byte variable containing our pin number and setting the `pinMode` within the `setup()` function.

```cpp
byte pwmPinNumber = 9;

void setup() {
  pinMode(pwmPins[pwmPinNumber], OUTPUT);
}
```

The setup for using the LED is thereby complete, next is creating the `loop()` function, which as a first test contains two for loops to fade the LED's brightness up and down.

```cpp
void loop() {
  for (int i = 0 ; i < 255; i++) {
    Breakout.analogWrite(pwmPins[pwmPinNumber], i);
    delay(5);
  }
  for (int i = 255; i > 0; i--) {
    Breakout.analogWrite(pwmPins[pwmPinNumber], i);
    delay(5);
  }
}
```

While uploading the sketch to the board, we should see the LED fading up and down in brightness. If that works as expected, we can proceed  connecting the potentiometer to our code.

### Analog Inputs Through the Portenta Breakout
Similar to the PWM code we need to define our pinNumber first, we will also create a variable to save the last value potentiometer value that has been read. Before the `setup()`function we therefore specify the following:

```cpp
byte analogPinNumber = 7;
uint32_t lastPotentiometerValue = -1;
```

Within the `setup()` function we can then initialize the serial connection so we can write the incoming value to the serial monitor.

```cpp
Serial.begin(9600);
while (!Serial);
Serial.println("Initialized Breakout Carrier example sketch");
```

Once we completed the setup, we can then update the loop `loop()` function to read the incoming potentiometer value and write it to the Serial Monitor. We can also update the PWM setting for the LED instead of fading up and down on repeat, to follow the potentiometers value.

```cpp
void loop() {
  uint32_t reading = Breakout.analogRead(analogPins[analogPinNumber]);

  if (reading != lastPotentiometerValue) {
    Serial.print("Potentiometer Value: ");
    Serial.println(reading);
    lastPotentiometerValue = reading;
  }

  uint32_t ledValue = map(reading, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
  Breakout.analogWrite(pwmPins[pwmPinNumber], ledValue);
}
```

Once the sketch is re-uploaded and we start the Serial Monitor, the Portenta starts reading the current potentiometer value and translates it into different brightness levels of our LED. 

## Conclusion
This sketch shows a simple usage of the Portenta Breakout in combination with the **Arduino_PortentaBreakout** Library to access and control some of the Portenta's High Density connectors. The library can thereby also be used for other protocols and pins such as I2C, UART and more. Within the "Next Steps" section below,there is a table of reference regarding how to address specific pins or what API to use.
