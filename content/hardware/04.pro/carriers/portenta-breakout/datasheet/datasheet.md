### DIP Switch
The DIP switch allows for boot mode configuration:
*   **BOOT SEL**: When set to ON, keeps the Portenta in Boot mode.
*   **BOOT**: When set to ON enables the embedded bootloader. Firmware can be uploaded via the USB port on the breakout board (DFU). USB-A to USB-A  (non-crossover) cable required. The Portenta H7 has to be powered through the USB-C® connector or VIN.

### RJ-45 Connector
The RJ-45 Connector allows to plug in an ethernet cable and connect to your network.

By default it is compatible with the **Arduino Portenta H7** as the jumper pads are joint with copper.

To **allow** compatibility with the **Arduino Portenta X8** it is needed to cut 2 jumper pads, located on top of the the RJ-45 Connector, below the SD holder, on the left side of the Carrier as shown in the following picture.

## Board Operation
**Note:** This board is intended to operate together with Portenta H7 (see section 1.4 Solution Overview).

### Getting Started - IDE
If you want to program your Portenta H7 with the Breakout Board while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE **[1]**. To connect your Portenta H7 with the Portenta Breakout Board to your computer, you will need a Type-C USB cable. This also provides power to both the Portenta H7 as well as the Portenta Breakout Board. Alternatively, in order to provide power to the USB connectors and the 5V pins, a 5V source must be applied to J8. This will also provide power to the Portenta H7.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor
All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Cloud Editor **[2]**, by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud
All Arduino IoT-enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud which allows you to log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Sample Sketches
Sample sketches can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino IDE or in the “Documentation” section of the Arduino Pro website **[4]**

### Online Resources
Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on ProjectHub **[5]**, the Arduino Library Reference **[6]** and the online store **[7]** where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more

### Board Recovery
In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after powering it up.

## Connector Pinouts
The Portenta Breakout Board provides easy access to the pins on the high-density connector of the Portenta family. The Portenta Breakout Board is shipped in a headerless configuration to provide flexibility in using 2.54mm compatible connectors to meet their specific application.

![Pinouts](assets/breakoutCarrierPinOut.jpg)

In cases where multiple channels are on a single header, the first channel is on the bottom part of the header and the section channel is on the top part of the header. The order of the channel is determined by the silkscreen markings.

Exemptions : No exemptions are claimed.

Arduino Boards are fully compliant with the related requirements of European Union Regulation (EC) 1907 /2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We declare none of the SVHCs (https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table), the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern for authorization currently released by ECHA, is present in all products (and also package) in quantities totaling in a concentration equal or above 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.

### Conflict Minerals Declaration
As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regards to laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder, or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas.F
