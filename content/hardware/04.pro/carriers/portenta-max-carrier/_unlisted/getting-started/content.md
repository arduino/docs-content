The Portenta Max Carrier was designed to augment the capabilities of the Portenta H7 board and provide easy access to its onboard peripherals. It is designed to enable research and develop industrial-grade advanced applications, from rapid prototyping to a deployable robust single-board computer.

The Portenta Max Carrier establishes a connection with Portenta H7 via High-Density connectors. This interface grants access to extensive modules and peripherals on-board the Portenta Max Carrier.

In this tutorial, we will describe the following features of the Portenta Max Carrier:

- Power distribution
- Connectors
- On-board memory units
- Wireless connectivity
- Audio interfaces
- On-board debugger

#### 1.1. Power Distribution

The Portenta Max Carrier provides several peripherals and modules to cover a wide spectrum of applications. For these peripherals and modules to be powered up and run, the Portenta Max Carrier is built upon a sophisticated electric power distribution architecture.

To power the Portenta Max Carrier, you can use the **barrel jack** connector (X1) or a **3.7V 18650 Li-Ion battery** connected to the Portenta Max Carrier's battery clips (J16 and J18). You can also power the Portenta Max Carrier directly from the USB-C® connector of the Portenta H7 board.

You can see the detailed Portenta Max Carrier's power tree in the image below:

![Portenta Max Carrier Power Distribution](assets/mc_ard_power_tree.png)

The following image shows the Portenta Max Carrier's power inputs:

![Portenta Max Carrier Power Inputs](assets/mc_ard_power.png)

These power feed line options power up different peripherals and modules depending on the line configuration. The Portenta H7 powered by USB-C® cable attached to Portenta Max Carrier enables Audio, LoRa®, USB Hub, SD port, and Fieldbus. The Debugger is also enabled, and it is also possible to upload the code at the same time. This power line use case will be useful to develop and debug the code.

**If the Arduino IDE throws an error failing to upload the code, please set the Portenta H7 in Bootloader Mode before uploading.**

The external power supply goes through [**MPM3550EGLE**](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/277/MPS_05172019_MPM3550E_r1.0-1595120.pdf), which is a DC/DC power module, to provide +5V to power up the peripherals and the modules. The module provides the power to [**BQ24195RGET**](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq24195.pdf?HQS=dis-mous-null-mousermode-dsf-pf-null-wwe&ts=1647034752895&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.mouser.com%252F), which is a battery charge and power path management, and it is used in Portenta Max Carrier for the Li-Ion battery source and to boost the voltage to +5V. The battery charger IC feeds the power to the Modem including all the peripherals and modules mentioned previously. The external power supply has the highest priority in the power line.

A Micro USB port is available for debugging on the Portenta Max Carrier. The debugging module is a separate segment, and it is powered by a Micro USB port using its power supply [**AP2112K**](https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/AP2112.pdf), which is a low-dropout linear regulator. The debugger is available for use without the Portenta H7 paired with the Portenta Max Carrier.

![Portenta Max Carrier Connectivity Module](assets/mc_ard_conn_module.png)

#### LoRaWAN® Module - Murata CMWX1ZZABZ-078

One of the notable features of Portenta Max Carrier is the Murata [CMWX1ZZABZ-078](https://www.murata.com/products/connectivitymodule/lpwa/overview/lineup/type-abz-078) that enables LoRaWAN® connectivity. LoRaWAN® is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) designed to connect low-power devices to the Internet. It was developed to meet and fulfill Internet of Things (IoT) devices' requirements, such as low-power consumption and low data throughput.

Depending on the region, it will require to use an appropriate antenna for the respective frequencies. The common frequencies are 915 MHz for North America and Australia, and 863 MHz for European region. Frequencies are on a range, so for example, Australian region is possible to use a 928 MHz compatible antenna and configuration.

***For more in-depth information about LoRa® and LoRaWAN®, please read [The Arduino Guide to LoRa® and LoRaWAN®](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/communication/lorawan-101).***

#### Cell Modem - SARA-R412M-02B

The Portenta Max Carrier carries a cellular modem SARA-R412M-02B to carry out tasks requiring general network connectivity. This cellular modem is capable of establishing **2G / Cat-M1 / NB-IoT** connections globally. It is powered by a bidirectional logic level shifter SN74LVC1T45 and an internal regulator, implemented for the use of SIM card and I/O.

The cellular modem requires SIM card integration, which can be fulfilled by introducing a SIM card in the available microSIM slot (SIM1). The modem has a dedicated SMA connector (J3) for the antenna.

***Please DO NOT USE the cellular modem without the external antenna attached to the SMA connector. It might damage the Portenta Max Carrier if used without.***

To begin using the modem, it will require some packages to be installed beforehand. Given the network technology, Cat-M1 and NB-IoT, it will require the use of the `MKRNB` library. Please also make sure to have the `Arduino Mbed OS Portenta Core` up to date from the board manager.

We will use the `arduino_secrets.h` header file for the PIN and APN configuration of the SIM card that will be inserted into the microSIM slot onboard Portenta Max Carrier.

If you want to learn how to run a sketch with this library or how to switch between Cat M1 and NB IoT, please take a look at our [Portenta Max Carrier and Portenta H7 Cat M1/NB IoT tutorial](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-max-carrier/catm1-and-nbiot)

The antenna connectors for both LoRaWAN® and cellular modem with the microSIM slot are indicated in the following image:

![Portenta Max Carrier Antenna Connectors and microSIM Slot](assets/mc_ard_antenna_sma.png)

#### Ethernet Connection

The Portenta Max Carrier has a physical Ethernet interface on-board, which is directly connected via High-Density Connectors of the Portenta board. The connector provides network activity status and speed indication via an LED indicator.

The 10/100 Ethernet is supported and the Gigabit connection is reserved for future use at the moment. The physical interface is indicated visually with the previous image showing antenna connectors and a microSIM slot.

#### 1.5. Audio Interfaces

The Portenta Max Carrier features a stereo CODEC, the [CS42L52](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/76/CS42L52_F2-1141287.pdf) from Cirrus Logic®. The CS42L52 is a 24-bit, low-power stereo CODEC that can provide up to 1W per channel of Class D stereo/mono amplification to external speakers (8-ohm stereo speakers and 4-ohm mono speakers) or enough power to drive 44mW per channel into stereo headphones. There are four analog audio interfaces in the Portenta Max Carrier, as shown in the image below:

![Portenta Max Carrier Audio Connectors](assets/mc_ard_audio_line.png)

You can use [this](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/5244/16056943) cable assembly and make your mono speaker. The CS42L52 stereo CODEC operates using an I2C interface, with the CODEC acting as a secondary device.

The Portenta H7 establishes an I2C interface using the `Wire` library included in the `ArduinoCore-mbed` package. The Portenta Max Carrier, while having paired the Portenta H7 via High-Density Connectors, can be expanded via Header Connector J5 for I2C interface interoperability. External modules requiring an I2C interface can be established via header Connector J5 with up to 2 available I2C bridges.

***For more information on I2C protocol, please have a look at this [guide to Arduino & the I2C Protocol (Two Wire)](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/communication/wire).***

#### 1.6. Onboard Debugger

Part of the development process, debugging process is crucial, and it is a required step if we are aiming now to work with industrial-grade devices. The Portenta Max Carrier provides discrete debugging capability onboard. The feature can be accessed via micro USB to J-Link debugger.

It is driven by an STM32F405RGT6 controller and compatible with Segger® J-Link OB and Blackmagic probes. The module itself does not require Portenta H7 to be attached to the Portenta Max Carrier, meaning it does not require VBUS.

***For more in-depth information about Debugging, please read [Debugging Fundamentals](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/debugging).***

The following image indicates the connectors that enable and allows to establish a connection to Portenta Max Carrier's onboard debugger.

![Portenta Max Carrier On-Board Debugger Connections](assets/mc_ard_debug_conn.png)

### 2. Basic Setup of the Portenta Max Carrier

The Portenta Max Carrier only requires the Portenta H7 as the main unit to be able to use it. External components are required to enable the onboard module's capability and correct operation, such as cellular modem and LoRaWAN® connectivity. As the Portenta H7 is the central control unit of the Portenta Max Carrier, it will need to have the latest **Arduino Mbed OS Portenta Core** installed.

If it is not installed or requires an update, it is possible to navigate under **Tools > Board > Board Manager** and search for the `Arduino Mbed OS Portenta Core` and proceed with the update.

To take advantage of Portenta Max Carrier's Power Architecture, an important physical configuration requires to be verified. A DIP Switch for Boot mode selection is present on the Portenta Max Carrier board. It requires setting **BOOT_SEL** to select between 2 boot addresses, which will enable Portenta H7 and Max Carrier to run the firmware. **BOOT** parameter will switch the Portenta H7 state into Boot mode.

Every time it initiates at Boot mode, the Portenta H7 will fade the Green LED to indicate its state. It will help to understand the board is in Boot mode and not turned off due to an unavailable electric supply as it shut off. As the power lines are alive even if the board shows no indication of an operating instance.

### 3. The Circuit

The Portenta Max Carrier uses the Portenta H7 as the main central processing unit and that powers up the carrier's modules mentioned above. Both systems possess High-Density Connectors to establish communication interfaces in between. It is simple as attaching the Portenta H7 to Portenta Max Carrier's High-Density Connectors. The following connection scheme shows how exactly the device is paired with the correct orientation.

![Portenta Max Carrier Hardware Setup](assets/mc_ard_hd_connectors.png)

The rest of the connection population will depend on the development requirement. It is important that if the connectivity modules are to be utilized, respective antennas should be attached before powering up. Otherwise, the Portenta Max Carrier may suffer from severe electronic hardware damage. Such details are drawn on the table with the briefly mentioned content above in `1.4. Wireless Connectivity` section.
