### Debugger 
Debugging capabilities are integrated directly into the Portenta Max Carrier and are accessible via microUSB (J10). The J-link debugger is compatible with the Segger® J-Link OB and Blackmagic probes, driven by the STM32F405RGT6 controller (U15). In addition to providing access to the Portenta board JTAG ports, different sniffer channels for I2C, CAN and UART lines.  The debugger firmware can be updated via SWD on CN3. Additionally, headers for debugging the LoRa® are accessible via CN2 with SWD.

### Audio
The Portenta Max Carrier enables connection connections to analog audio channels. This is done through the low power CS42L52 stereo CODEC providing ADC/DAC between analog signals and the I2S protocol. An internal Class D amplifier eliminates the need for external audio amplification circuitry. Configuration of the CS42L52 is achieved over I2C. The CS42L52 IC operates over the 1V8 rail.

There are four analog audio interfaces accessible on the Portenta Max Carrier:

*   1x audio jack for right line (J13)
*   1x audio jack for left line in (J14)
*   1x audio jack for stereo headphone line out (J12)
*   1x connector for speaker out (J20)

**Note:** Audio not supported with the Portenta H7.

### Cell Modem 
The SARA-R412M-02B (U1) is a multi-region modem capable of connecting to 2G/Cat-M1/NBIoT networks worldwide. A dedicated SMA connector (J3) allows for an external antenna. The chip operates over the 1V8 power line. A microSIM slot is available (SIM1). SN74LVC1T45 bidirectional logic level shifters (U8, U20, U21, U22) act as middleware for connecting to 3V3 serial connections. The chip is powered by 3V8 and an internal regulator provides 1V8 that is used for the SIM card and the I/O. The corresponding SIM card slot for the cell modem is on the top side of the board, directly adjacent to the module.

### LoRa® Module
The Portenta Max Carrier provides long range wireless connectivity for low bandwidth applications with the on-board Murata CMWX1ZZABZ-078 LoRa® transceiver module (U23). This module operates on 3V3. A dedicated SMA connector (J9) allows for an external antenna. Serial wire debug (SWD) headers are accessible via CN2.

### Mini PCIe 
The Portenta Max Carrier includes one female mini PCI Express card slot (J8). The connector is right angled and the board includes 2 removable standoffs for external module support. To use the spacer, add the plastic spacer on the top side of the board then attach the M2.5 screw from the back together with the washer. The Max Carrier supports two different Mini PCIe sizes. Pins 8, 10, 12 and 14 are reserved for UIM (in this case SIM).

**Note:** USB, I2C and SIM functionality over PCIe is available only for the X8. Full PCIe functionality not provided at this time.

### USB
The Portenta Max Carrier also includes a USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Hub controller based on the USB2514B/M2 (U3) that manages the 2 USB devices from the USB type A connector (J15) plus the LoRa® (U23) and PCIe (J8) modules. J15 is protected by a NCP383LMUAJAATXG (U7) power switch and current limiter. 

### Ethernet 
The Gigabit Ethernet physical interface (J17) is directly connected to the high density connector to the Portenta board. The connector includes an activity LED indication (orange) and speed indication (green).

**Note:** Gigabit Ethernet functionality is only supported on the Portenta X8.

### Serial Transceiver 
The Portenta Max Carrier includes a multi-protocol transceiver supporting RS-232, RS-485, and RS-422 serial standards (configurable) based on the SP335 IC. It is connected to a 6P6C Connector (RJ11, RJ12, RJ14, RJ25).

Default configuration:
*   Full Duplex
*   232 protocol
*   No data rate limit
*   Enabled

### CAN Transceiver
The Portenta Max Carrier includes a high speed CAN transceiver based on the TJA1049T/3J IC. It is connected to a 4P4C connector (RJ9, RJ10, RJ22).

### Micro SD Card Slot
The on board Micro SD card can be used for data logging operations.

### Power Tree
![Power tree](assets/maxCarrierPowerTree.svg)

The Portenta Max Carrier can either be powered through the power jack (X1) or a 18650 Li-ion/LiPo battery (J16, J18). The battery is charged while the minimum input voltage to X1 is met. The MPM3550EGLE (U6) provides a +5V rail to power the peripherals. This IC also provides power to the BQ24195RGET IC (U11) that manages the Li-ion battery and boosts the voltage to +5V. U11 also determines the battery status. 

The power source can be determined by querying the System Status Register of U11 and check the PG_STAT field. PG_STAT = 1 means the board is powered with a power source on VBUS. Please refer to the IC [datasheet](/resources/datasheets/bq24195-datasheet.pdf) for further details.

Priority is with the jack delivered power. The battery charger IC also outputs a +3V8 power rail that powers the modem (U1). The +5V power rail provides power to the Portenta board that regulates the voltage with its onboard buck converter to +3V3. The +3V3 power rail supplies power to the LoRa module (U23), 4-port USB hub (U3), microSD module (J11) and Fieldbus circuitry (U4). Audio is powered by a dedicated AP7311 LDO regulator that provides a low noise +1V8 power rail. 

The debugger circuitry has a dedicated power supply AP2112K (U14) that runs off the micro USB voltage from J10. This enables the debugger to operate even if the Portenta board is not inserted.

Voltage range and max current are provided as a general guideline only. Consult converter datasheet for specific details.

Exemptions : No exemptions are claimed. 

Arduino Boards are fully compliant with the related requirements of European Union Regulation (EC) 1907 /2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We declare none of the SVHCs (https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table), the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern for authorization currently released by ECHA, is present in all products (and also package) in quantities totaling in a concentration equal or above 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.

### Conflict Minerals Declaration 
As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regards to laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder, or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas. 

## FCC Caution
Any Changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment.

This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: 

 (1) This device may not cause harmful interference

 (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.

**FCC RF Radiation Exposure Statement:**
