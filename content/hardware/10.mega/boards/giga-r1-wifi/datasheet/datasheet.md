# The Board

## Application Examples

The GIGA R1 WiFi combines the best of the Portenta H7 and the Mega 2560. A generous amount of I/O easily accessible via pins allows for easy and fast testing of new ideas and solutions. The STM32H7 has ample power to handle machine-learning tasks. Your IoT projects can even benefit from the Arduino Cloud with the help of the onboard secure element and its wireless connectivity.

- **3D Printing:** The Mega form factor has been very popular for creating 3D printers. Connect sensors to the high-resolution ADC interfaces for high-performance sensing of the 3D printing process. Together with the dual-core computing power, control the printing process like never before. Monitor filament usage and print status locally over Bluetooth® or from anywhere in the world with the Arduino Cloud, or any other third-party service, and its Wi-Fi® features.

- **Audio Processing:** The GIGA R1 WiFi provides a 3.5 mm audio input/output to easily interact with audio signals in the environment. Analyse and create audio signals directly on the board.

## Processor

The GIGA R1 WiFi's main processor is the dual-core STM32H747 (U1) including a Arm® Cortex®-M7 running at 480 MHz and a Arm® Cortex®-M4 running at 240 MHz. The two cores communicate via a _Remote Procedure Call_ mechanism that allows calling functions between each processor seamlessly.

## Wi-Fi®/Bluetooth® Connectivity

The Murata® LBEE5KL1DX-883 wireless module (U5) simultaneously provides Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® connectivity in an ultra-small package based on the Cypress CYW4343W. The IEEE802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi® interface can be operated as an access point (AP), station (STA) or as a dual mode simultaneous AP/STA and supports a maximum transfer rate of 65 Mbps. Bluetooth® interface supports Bluetooth® Classic and Bluetooth® Low Energy. An integrated antenna circuitry switch allows a single external antenna (J14) to be shared between Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth®.

## Onboard Memories

The GIGA R1 WiFi supplements the 2 MB Flash and 1 MB SRAM on the STM32H747 (U1) with 16 MB of NOR Flash with the AT25SF128A-MHB-T (U8) as well as 8 MB of SDRAM with the AS4C4M16SA (U3). U8 connects over a Quad-SPI interface to the main processor (U1). U3 operates at a frequency of 166 MHz.

## USB Connector

Two USB ports are provided on the GIGA R1 WiFi. One USB 2.0 type A (J2) and a USB-C® (J12). The USB 2.0 connector allows external devices to be connected as peripherals, while the USB-C® connector allows the GIGA board to be connected as a peripheral for other devices. Note that super speed pins on the USB-C® connector (J12) are unpopulated. A TVS diode array is placed on the VBUS of each connector (D4, D2) for ESD protection purposes.

## Audio

The STM32H7 (U1) has two digital-to-analog converters (DAC) which drive the stereo audio output on the 3.5 mm jack connector (J15). Each DAC has a resolution of up to 12 bits. The right and left channels are also accessible via pins DAC0 and DAC1 respectively. A microphone input is also present on the jack connector (J15), which is shared with analog pin A7. The _Buffered mode_ in the STM32H7 can allow for low-impedance output while _Sample and hold_ functionality can help to reduce power consumption. Up to 10 mega samples per second are supported.

## Power Tree

![Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi Power Tree](assets/GIGA_R1_WiFi_Power_Tree.png)

Power can either be supplied via the VIN pins, or the 5V of the USB connectors (J2, J12). If power is supplied via VIN, the MP2269GD-Z (U7) buck converter steps the voltage down to 5V. The 5V power rail is then stepped down to 3.3V by the MP2322GQH (U6) buck converter. The logic level of components on the GIGA R1 WiFi is 3.3V.

## Board Operation

### Getting Started - IDE

If you want to program your GIGA R1 WiFi while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE **[1]**. To connect the GIGA R1 WiFi to your computer, you will need a Type-C® USB cable, which can also provide power to the board, as indicated by the LED (DL1).

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor

All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Cloud Editor **[2]**, by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud

All Arduino IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud which allows you to log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Online Resources

Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on  Arduino Project Hub **[4]**, the Arduino Library Reference **[5]**, and the online store **[6]**; where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.

### Board Recovery

All Arduino boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB, it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after the power-up.

Exemptions : No exemptions are claimed.

Arduino Boards are fully compliant with the related requirements of European Union Regulation (EC) 1907 /2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We declare none of the SVHCs ([https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table](https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table)), the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern for authorization currently released by ECHA, is present in all products (and also package) in quantities totaling in a concentration equal or above 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.

## Conflict Minerals Declaration

As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regards to laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder, or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas.
