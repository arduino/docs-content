<FeatureDescription>

The GIGA Display Shield has a 3.97” 480x800 RGB touch screen, a digital microphone, a 6-axis IMU and an RGB LED. The shield can easily be mounted on the GIGA R1 WiFi board.

Utilizing the GIGA R1 WiFi's fast 480 MHz microcontroller, you can build powerful UIs, use interactive 3D animations, display camera feed and much more. The shield is compatible with a wide range of graphics libraries, including [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl), [GFX](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_GigaDisplay_GFX/) and [ArduinoGraphics](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoGraphics/).
