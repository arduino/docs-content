## TFT Display

The KD040WVFID026-01-C025A TFT Display has a 3.97" diagonal size with two connectors. The J4 connector for video (DSI) signals and the J5 connector for the touch panel signals. TFT display and capacitance touch panel resolution is 480 x 800 with a pixel size of 0.108 mm. The touch module communicates via I2C to the main board. The edge LED backlight is driven by the LV52204MTTBG (U3) LED Driver.

## 6-Axis IMU
The GIGA Display Shield provides 6-axis IMU capabilities, via the 6-axis BMI270 (U7) IMU. The BMI270 includes both a three-axis gyroscope as well as a three-axis accelerometer. The information obtained can be used for measuring raw movement parameters as well as for machine learning. The BMI270 is connected to the GIGA R1 WiFi via a common I2C connection.

## RGB LED

A common anode RGB (DL1) is driven by a dedicated IS31FL3197-QFLS2-TR RGB LED Driver IC (U2) which can deliver sufficient current to each LED. The RGB LED Driver is connected via a common I2C connection to the GIGA main board. An included integrated charge pump ensures that the voltage delivered to the LED is sufficient. 

## Digital Microphone

The MP34DT06JTR is an ultra-compact, low-power, omnidirectional, digital MEMS microphone built with a capacitive sensing element and an PDM interface. The sensing element, capable of detecting acoustic waves, is manufactured using a specialized silicon micromachining process dedicated to produce audio sensors. The microphone is in a single channel configuration, with audio signals transmitter over PDM.

## Power Tree

![Arduino GIGA Display Shield Power Tree](assets/GIGA_Display_Shield_Power_Tree.png)

The 3V3 voltage power is delivered by the GIGA R1 WiFi (J6 and J7). All onboard logic including the microphone (U1) and IMU (U7) operate at 3V3. The RGB LED Driver includes an integrated charge pump which increases the voltage as defined by the I2C commands. The edge backlight intensity is controlled by the LED driver (U3).

## Board Operation

### Getting Started - IDE

If you want to program your GIGA Display Shield while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE **[1]**. A GIGA R1 WiFi is needed to use it. 

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor

All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Cloud Editor **[2]**, by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud

All Arduino IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud which allows you to log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Online Resources

Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on Arduino Project Hub **[4]**, the Arduino Library Reference **[5]** and the online store **[6]** where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.
