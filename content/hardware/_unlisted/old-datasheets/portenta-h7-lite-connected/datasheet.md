## The Board
### Application Examples
Due to the dual core processing and the low-power capabilities, Portenta supports a wide array of applications.

**Machine Vision:** In combination with the Portenta Vision Shield it can run machine vision applications. This allows to detect the presence or movement of objects in a video stream.

**AI & Machine Learning:**  Thanks to the power of the two cores it can simultaneously read data from sensors or other devices on one core while the other core processes the data stream and uses machine learning to make sense of the data. When used with the Portenta Vision Shield its camera module or the two directional microphones can be used as data sources.

**Connectivity:** The Portenta features on-board Bluetooth®  and WiFi capabilities which makes it the perfect candidate for reliable IoT applications. When used together with the Portenta Vision Shield it enables LoRa communication in places where it needs to communicate efficiently over a long distance. The Portenta Vision Shield also features an Ethernet port that allows for wired networking applications.

### Accessories
The [Portenta Vision Shield](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/portenta-vision-shield) is a rapid pathway to developing applications that combine vision, audio and connectivity. The ultra low power HM-01B0 CMOS image sensor is designed with always-on applications in mind. The 324x324 data stream can be used with either the Arduino toolchain or OpenMV for gestures, ambient light, proximity sensing, and object identification. The large pixel size (3.6μm) provides a high signal-to-noise ratio. The two omnidirectional digital-microphones (MP34DB02) allows concurrent capture of stereo sounds alongside the video stream on the MicroSD Card, as well as for beamforming uses. Connectivity is provided by either ethernet or LoRa technology. LoRa technology enables the use of this platform as part of wireless sensor network solutions.

### Processor
Main processor is a dual core Cortex M7 running at up to 480 MHz and a Cortex M4 running at up to 240 MHz. The two cores communicate with each other via a hardware assisted mailbox on which Arduino implements a Remote Procedure Call mechanism that allows calling functions on the other processor seamlessly.

Both processors can share all the peripherals and resources and both can run the following applications:

*   Arduino sketches on top of mbed
*   Native mbed applications
*   MicroPython/Javascript interpreter
*   TensorFlow Lite

In all combinations of applications it is possible to invoke synchronous or asynchronous API calls. For example it is possible to extend Python® language with functions implemented as Arduino sketches that are executed in parallel to other Python® functions by the opposite core.

Processor’s various power modes allow quickly switching between high performance and very low power configurations, optimizing power consumption whenever cores are idle.

Internal memory is composed of 2MB of flash with read while write support and 1MB of RAM partitioned as follows:

*   192 Kbytes of Tightly Coupled Memory for time critical routines
    *   64 Kbytes  instruction
    *   128 Kbytes of data
*   864 Kbytes of user SRAM
*   4 Kbytes of SRAM in Backup domain 

### Wireless Module 
The on board wireless module allows simultaneous management of WiFi and Bluetooth®  connectivity. The WiFi interface can be operated as an Access Point, as a Station or as a dual mode simultaneous AP/STA and can handle up to 65 Mbps transfer rate. Bluetooth®  interface supports Bluetooth®  Classic and Bluetooth® Low Energy.  

### External Memories
Optionally Portenta H7 Lite Connected is available with additional external SDRAM and QSPI Flash memories.

External SDRAM can provide up to 64 MByte directly mapped in CPU addressing space and allows code execution.

External QSPI flash can provide up to 128MByte of storage and can be either memory mapped for code execution (read only) or used as a QSPI peripheral for data storage.   

### Crypto Chips
Portenta H7 Lite Connected runs the classic ATECC608A.

### Ethernet Phy
The optional 10/100 Ethernet physical interface is directly connected to the internal Ethernet MAC and provides full duplex communication with automatic MDIX support. The Wake On Lan functionality allows reducing power consumption when in sleep mode.  

### High Speed USB Phy
The optional High Speed USB Phy is one of the two USB interfaces available on the high speed connectors and is also available on the USB-C® connector. High Speed USB PHY allows transfer rates of up to 480 Mbps and can be used both as a host and as a device.

When using the USB-C® connector only one USB port is usable on high speed connectors.

When the High Speed USB Phy option is not assembled the USB-C® port only one Full Speed port is available and is shared between USB-C® and High Density connectors  

### USB-C® Connector 
USB-C® connector supports multiple use case scenarios and provides the following functions:

*   Provide board power supply in both DFP and DRP mode
*   Source power to external peripherals when board is powered through VIN
*   expose High Speed (480Mbps) or Full Speed (12 Mbps) USB Host/Device interface

### Power Tree
All power conversion on the Portenta H7 Lite Connected is handled by the PF1550 PMIC. Current is drawn by VUSB, VIN or VBATT automatically according to rules specified by the PMIC. The VCC is driven by a buck converter configured to provide 3V3 that is accessible on both the MKR headers and the HDR connector. Two other buck converters provide 3V1 and 2V8 outputs. Additionally, three precision LDO provide low-ripple outputs of 1V0, 1V2 and 1V8.  Voltage range and max current are provided as a general guideline only. Consult the PF1550 datasheet for specific details.

Exemptions : No exemptions are claimed. 

Arduino Boards are fully compliant with the related requirements of European Union Regulation (EC) 1907 /2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We declare none of the SVHCs (https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table), the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern for authorization currently released by ECHA, is present in all products (and also package) in quantities totaling in a concentration equal or above 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.

### Conflict Minerals Declaration 
As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regards to laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder, or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas.
