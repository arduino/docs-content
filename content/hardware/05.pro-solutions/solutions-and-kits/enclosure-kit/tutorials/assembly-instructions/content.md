The enclosure kit features an LCD screen on top and a perfectly fitted case for the Arduino Edge Control.

### Required Hardware and Software

- [Arduino® Edge Control](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-edge-control)
- [Arduino® Enclosure Kit]()

## Assemble the Kit

Once you got all the parts and an Edge Control, we can start with placing the Edge Control into the bottom part of the enclosure kit.

Now place the LCD screen into the top part of the enclosure kit.

To connect the screen to the carrier, plug one end of the cord into the under side of the LCD screen, the other end of the cord goes into the LCD connector on the Edge Control.
