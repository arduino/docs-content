====================WisGateOS 2 v2.2.2====================
February 27, 2024

IMPORTANT UPDATE NOTICE:
- The WisGateOS2 firmware has been updated significantly. After this update, it is no longer possible to revert to previous versions of WisDM or the local WebUI. All WisGateOS2 2.2.x extensions are digitally signed. During this process, extensions will automatically update. Contact RAK support before updating the WireGuard Extension.
- An internet connection is mandatory for the update process. This is because the new firmware signature needs to be confirmed, and the Extension Gallery should be accessible to update the already installed extensions.

New Features: 
- Upgraded OpenWRT to version 2102 to enhance system security and reliability.
- Online extension updated with signature verification.
- Added Chinese Language support in gateway UI.
- Display syslog in sequence in gateway UI for download.
- Now supports spaces in ESSID.
- TDOA support in gateway UI.
- ChirpStack V4 (MQTT Bridge) integration.
- WisDM agent updated to v1.2.5 to allow adding gateways in Basics Station mode without erasing individual keys. 
- Support Client ID for user to fill in when the gateway works in Built-in NS mode.
