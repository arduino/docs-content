### Digital Inputs
The digital inputs connector has 8x channels, each is a 680 kΩ and 100 kΩ resistor divider: a 0-24V input is scaled down to 0-3V.

### Digital Outputs

The Portenta Machine Control has the following outputs specifications:

- 8x high side switches (2x **TPS4H160AQPWPRQ1**), one for each channel.
- The current limit nominal value is 0.6A per channel. Due to internal **TPS4H160AQPWPRQ1** circuit tolerances, the real value can be higher, up to 0.9A.

The digital output connector (J6) has a 24V IN pin which must be supplied with 24V DC. The 24V IN pin is not galvanically isolated: the input voltage must be referred to the same GND of the board.

The supply voltage can be the same 24V which is powering the board.

### Programmable Digital I/O
The **programmable digital I/O** connector has a 24V IN pin which must be supplied with 24V DC.

The 24V IN pin is not galvanically isolated: the input voltage must be referred to the same GND of the board.

The supply voltage can be the same 24V which is powering the board. There are 3x **TPS4H160AQPWPRQ1** chipsets, one for each channel, having a total of 12x high-side switches.

#### Current Limit
- The nominal value is 0.6A per channel, however, due to the internal **TPS4H160AQPWPRQ1** circuit tolerances the real value can be reach up to 0.9A.
- It is possible to change the behavior of the 12 channels when the current limit is reached:
  - **Latch**: when the current limit is reached the channel is shut down and the co-respective channel *enable* pin must be toggled to activate the channel again.
  - **Retry**: when the current limit is reached the channel is shut down and re-connected after a short period of time.

#### Kick-Back Protection
There is an internal inductive loads kick-back protection with an additional external protection of a 60V, 2A Schottky diode **PMEG6020ER**:

- 12x digital input channels, each is a 680 kΩ and 100 kΩ resistor divider: a 0-24V input is scaled down to 0-3V.
  Although the high-side switches are independent of the digital input channels, it is possible to read the status of the high-side switches through the digital input channels.

### Analog Input
The internal A/D converter of the microcontroller has a range resolution of 12-16 bits, delivering decimal values from 0 to a maximum of 65535 and being configurable by the user via software.

There are three independent analog input channels available. Each of them has an analog switch **TS12A44514PWR** which is switching between three modes:

- **0-10V**:
The input is connected to a 100 kΩ and 39 kΩ resistor divider. A 0-10V input is scaled down to 0-2.8V. The input impedance is approximately 28 kΩ.
- **4-20mA**:
The input is connected to a 120Ω resistor. Having 4-20mA current input for a 0.48V-2.4V voltage.
- **NTC**:
The input is connected to a 3V voltage reference (**REF3330AIRSER**) with a 100 kΩ resistor in series, becoming part of a resistor divider powered by the voltage reference.

An output pin provides 24V to power sensors. A 500mA PTC resettable fuse protects the 24V output pin.

### Analog Output
Four independent analog output channels are available. Each of them has a double low-pass filter and a high-current op-amp arranged in a non-inverting topology with a gain of 3.3.

![Analog Output Circuit](assets/MachineControlAnalogOutputScheme.svg)

At each input of each channel, a PWM from the Portenta board is provided and filtered by a double low-pass filter, obtaining a DC output with a small AC ripple. The signal is then fed to the channel non-inverting amplifier which amplifies it by 3.3.

The output signal is a DC whose amplitude is a function of the PWM duty cycle.

The maximum output current is 20mA per channel.

Analog Out Channel 2 (AO2) is connected to pin PG7 on the Portenta H7 and features an HRTIM (High-Resolution Timer) function. The HRTIM configuration includes a frequency of 200 MHz (tick time = 5 ns), a clock prescaler of 4, and a maximum period of 65533 ticks (1.31 ms). This results in a maximum period of ~1.3 ms, making AO2 suitable mainly for high-frequency PWM signals.

For applications requiring periods longer than 1.3 ms, consider using Analog Out Channels 0, 1, or 3, which use standard timers.

### Temperature Measurements
Three independent temperature measurement channels are available.

Each channel can measure non-grounded thermocouples or PT100 sensors, but not both at the same time.

**NOTE**: **Do not connect both a thermocouple and a PT100 to one channel**.
Only a single channel at a time is available to be read, according to the analog switch's position.

### Front-Ends
There are two front ends on the board:
- MAX31855KASA+T dedicated to thermocouples.
- MAX31865ATP+T dedicated to PT100.

The front ends are multiplexed to the three channels via:
  - A single low-ohmic single-pole double-throw analog switch **NX3L4053HR,115** which is switching between one front end or the other.
  - Three quadruple single pole single throw analog switches **TMUX1511RSVR** which are switching the active channel between the three available.

### Connecting Thermocouples
**WARNING**: Connect only **non-grounded** thermocouples. Do not connect a thermocouple and a PT100 to the same channel.

Connect a **thermocouple** to a channel `CH` (0-2):

## Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)

MTBF, which stands for Mean Time Between Failure, is calculated according to statistical device failures and indicates the reliability of a device.

The MTBF figure (in hours/years) for the Portenta Machine Control can be found in the table below. The MTBF figure was calculated according to the MIL-HDBK-217F part count method.

|  **Standard** | **Portenta Machine Control** | **Environmental Conditions** |
|:-------------:|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| MIL-HDBK-217F |       513550 h/58 years      |             25 ºC            |

**Important note**: MTBF is the statistical representation of the likelihood of a unit failing and _does not necessarily represent a product's life_.
