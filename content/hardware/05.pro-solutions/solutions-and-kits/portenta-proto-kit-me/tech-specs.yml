Kit:
  Name: Arduino Portenta Proto Kit ME
  SKU: AKX00073
Components:
  Portenta H7:
    Dual-core processing (ARM Cortex® M7 at 480 MHz and M4 at 240 MHz) with advanced graphics capabilities at an industrial operating range (-40 °C to 85 °C).
  Nicla Sense ME:
    Equipped with advanced sensors for motion, pressure, temperature, humidity and indoor air quality monitoring, this board combines Bluetooth® connectivity with edge AI capabilities in a compact design (22.86 mm x 22.86 mm).
  Portenta Mid Carrier:
    Expands the connectivity of Portenta family boards by providing Ethernet, USB-A, mPCIe, CAN, and MicroSD support. It includes debugging features via onboard JTAG pins and supports additional interfaces such as I2C, SPI, PWM, digital and analog I/Os.
  Portenta Mid Carrier Proto Shield:
    Supports Nicla family boards, Modulinos, Arduino UNO shields and includes ESLOV (x2) and Qwiic (x1) connectors.
  Arduino Pro 4G Module Global:
    Provides global LTE Cat.4 connectivity and GNSS support.
  Modulinos:
    KNOB: Encoder with a push button for fine value adjustments (x1)
    PIXELS: 8 RGB LEDs for visual feedback (x1)
    DISTANCE: Time-of-Flight sensor for measuring proximity (x1)
    MOVEMENT: 6-axis IMU to capture movement (x1)
    BUTTONS: Three push buttons and three yellow LEDs (x1)
    BUZZER: For generating alarms or tunes (x1)
    THERMO: For temperature and humidity readings (x1)
Power:
  Input Voltage:
    +5 VDC: Through USB-C® connector of the Portenta H7 or in the Portenta Mid Carrier terminal pins.
    +7-30 VDC: Via Portenta Mid Carrier Proto Shield onboard dedicated power jack.
