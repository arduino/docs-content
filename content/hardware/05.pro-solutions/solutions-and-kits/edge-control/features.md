<FeatureDescription>

The **Edge control** can be positioned anywhere and is suitable for precision farming, smart agriculture, and other applications requiring intelligent control in remote locations. Power can be either supplied via solar panel or DC input. Remotely control your application through the **Arduino Cloud** (or third-party services) using a choice of connectivity options suitable to the location.

<Feature title="Smart agriculture" image="humidity-sensor">

  Particularly suited to smart agriculture, the sensors can collect real-time data such as weather conditions, soil quality, crop growth, amongst others. Once sent to the Arduino Cloud, the data value chain becomes valuable analytics that supports business processes at various levels (e.g. crop yield, equipment efficiency, staff performance, etc.). The Arduino Edge Control has the capability to improve crop quality and reduce human effort/error by automating processes like irrigation, fertilization, or pest control.
