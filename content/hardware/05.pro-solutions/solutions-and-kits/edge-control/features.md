<FeatureDescription>

The **Edge control** can be positioned anywhere and is suitable for precision farming, smart agriculture, and other applications requiring intelligent control in remote locations. Power can be either supplied via solar panel or DC input. Remotely control your application through the **Arduino Cloud** (or third-party services) using a choice of connectivity options suitable to the location.

<Feature title="MKR slots" image="mkr-form-factor">

  The on-board MKR slots 1 & 2 can be used to connect Arduino MKR boards to extend the capabilities such as connectivity through LoRa®, Wi-Fi®, 2G/3G/CatM1/NBIoT, and Sigfox.

</Feature>

<Feature title="Watermark Sensors" image="humidity-sensor">

  The Edge Control can handle up to 16 watermark sensor inputs, being a suitable solution for soil humidity measurements on big crop fields.

</Feature>

<Feature title="Solid State Relays" image="settings">

  The Edge Control features four galvanically isolated solid state relays (SSR) that can handle up to 2.5 A and 60 VAC. 

</Feature>

<Feature title="4-20 mA Sensors" image="communication">

  The Edge Control features four 4-20 mA sensor inputs, perfect to support a vast variety of industrial sensors. 

</Feature>

<Feature title="Latching Outputs" image="connection">

  The Edge Control features eight latching outputs, perfect for driving latching motorized or solenoid valves.

</Feature>

<Feature title="Power Flexibility" image="power">

  The Edge Control can be powered by a 12 VDC power supply or by a lead-acid battery. Also, it supports a solar panel connection to recharge the battery and ensure the device functions even in remote off-the-grid deployments.
