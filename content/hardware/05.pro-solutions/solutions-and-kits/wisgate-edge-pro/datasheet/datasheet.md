| Operating Humidity        | 0% to 95% (non-condensing)    |
| Storage Humidity          | 0% to 95% (non-condensing)    |
| Ingress Protection Rating | IP67 (dust-tight, waterproof) |
| Pollution Degree          | 2 (IEC 61010 compliant)       |

<div style="background-color: #FFFFE0; border-left: 6px solid #FFD700; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Note:</strong> The device's IP67 rating ensures it is fully dust-protected and can withstand immersion up to defined limits, suitable for harsh outdoor environments.
</p>
</div>

### Power Specification

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The WisGate Edge Pro gateway supports multiple power supply options suitable for various installation scenarios:
</p>

- **Power over Ethernet (PoE)**: Supports IEEE 802.3af standard (37 to 57 VDC input voltage). Use an IEEE 802.3af compliant PoE injector or switch for proper operation. The PoE port provides 10/100 Mbps Ethernet connectivity.
- **External DC Power Supply**: Supports a dedicated external 12 VDC power source via the DC barrel jack. Use the 12V/1A power adapter or a regulated 12 VDC supply with at least 2 A capacity to ensure stable operation.

| **Property**                | **Min** | **Typical** | **Max** | **Unit** |
|-----------------------------|---------|-------------|---------|----------|
| PoE Input Voltage (802.3af) | 37      | -           | 57      | VDC      |
| DC Input Voltage            | 11      | 12          | 13      | VDC      |
| Power Consumption           | -       | 12          | 17      | W        |

<div style="background-color: #FFFFE0; border-left: 6px solid #FFD700; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Warning:</strong> Always use IEEE 802.3af compliant PoE injectors or switches to prevent potential damage or malfunction. If using a DC power supply, ensure it is a regulated 12 VDC source capable of supplying at least 2 A to accommodate peak power consumption.
</p>
</div>

### Current Consumption

The table below provides the typical current consumption values under different normal operating conditions:

| **Condition**           | **Min** | **Typical** | **Max** | **Unit** |
|-------------------------|---------|-------------|---------|----------|
| PoE powered (at 48 VDC) | -       | 0.3 - 0.35  | 0.5     | A        |
| DC Powered (12 V input) | -       | 1.0         | 1.5     | A        |

<div style="background-color: #FFFFE0; border-left: 6px solid #FFD700; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Note:</strong> Current consumption may vary depending on the operational load (LoRa® traffic, Wi-Fi®, LTE usage), environmental conditions and peripheral device connections. If operating at maximum load, use DC power instead of PoE, as 802.3af PoE may not supply sufficient power under peak conditions.
</p>
</div>

Exemptions: No exemptions are claimed.

Arduino Boards are fully compliant with the related requirements of European Union Regulation (EC) 1907 /2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We declare none of the SVHCs (https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table), the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern for authorization currently released by ECHA, is present in all products (and also package) in quantities totaling in a concentration equal or above 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.

### Conflict Minerals Declaration

As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations concerning laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder, or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence, Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas.

## FCC Caution

Any Changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment.

This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions:

1. This device may not cause harmful interference

2. This device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.

**FCC RF Radiation Exposure Statement:**

1. This Transmitter must not be co-located or operating in conjunction with any other antenna or transmitter

2. This equipment complies with RF radiation exposure limits set forth for an uncontrolled environment

3. This equipment should be installed and operated with a minimum distance of 20 cm between the radiator and your body.

**Note:** This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital
device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide
reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment
generates, uses and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in
accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications.
However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If
this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be
determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the
interference by one or more of the following measures:
- Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.
- Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.
- Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the
receiver is connected.
- Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help.

English:
User manuals for license-exempt radio apparatus shall contain the following or equivalent notice in a conspicuous location in the user manual or alternatively on the device or both. This device complies with Industry Canada license-exempt RSS standard(s). Operation is subject to the following two conditions:

1. This device may not cause interference

2. This device must accept any interference, including interference that may cause undesired operation of the device.

French:
Le présent appareil est conforme aux CNR d’Industrie Canada applicables aux appareils radio exempts de licence. L’exploitation est autorisée aux deux conditions suivantes:

1. L’ appareil nedoit pas produire de brouillage

2. L’utilisateur de l’appareil doit accepter tout brouillage radioélectrique subi, même si le brouillage est susceptible d’en compromettre le fonctionnement.

**IC SAR Warning:**

English:
This equipment should be installed and operated with a minimum distance of 20 cm between the radiator and your body.

French:
Lors de l’ installation et de l’ exploitation de ce dispositif, la distance entre le radiateur et le corps est d ’au moins 20 cm.

**Important:** The operating temperature of the EUT can’t exceed 85 °C and shouldn’t be lower than -40 °C.

Hereby, Arduino S.r.l. declares that this product is in compliance with essential requirements and other relevant provisions of Directive 2014/53/EU. This product is allowed to be used in all EU member states.
