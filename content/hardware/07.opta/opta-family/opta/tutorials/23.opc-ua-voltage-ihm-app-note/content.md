## Introduction

Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) play a vital role in enabling effective interaction between operators and industrial systems, supporting efficient control, monitoring, and decision-making processes. By providing clear visualization and intuitive controls, HMIs enable operators to monitor system status and respond to issues in real time. For example, visual indicators for voltage levels can help operators identify and address potential problems before they impact operations.

The functionality of HMIs depends on efficient and reliable communication across all connected components. This is achieved through the integration of robust communication protocols. One such protocol is Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC-UA), recognized for its flexibility, security, and compatibility with a wide range of automation platforms. Through OPC-UA, HMIs can ensure reliable data exchange and interoperability, further optimizing industrial system performance.

## OPC-UA Protocol

Before continuing to discuss this application note, let's briefly explain what the OPC-UA protocol is.

The OPC-UA protocol is a modern communication standard designed for industrial automation and IIoT applications. It provides a secure, platform-independent, and scalable framework for exchanging data between devices and systems. In this application, the protocol facilitates seamless communication between the Arduino Opta™ and the Ignition platform, enabling the creation of an HMI for real-time monitoring and control.

![OPC-UA Logo](assets/opc-ua-logo.png)

OPC-UA operates on a client-server model, where the server (e.g., the Arduino Opta™) gathers and organizes data, making it accessible as structured nodes. The client (e.g., the Ignition platform) requests or subscribes to this data to receive real-time updates. Additionally, the protocol supports bidirectional communication, allowing clients to send commands back to servers to trigger specific actions. 

Data exchange in OPC-UA is both secure and efficient, leveraging features such as encryption, authentication, and access control. While it is typically transported over TCP/IP to ensure reliable and ordered communication, OPC-UA is transport-independent, allowing it to operate over other protocols such as HTTPS or WebSockets. This flexibility makes OPC-UA highly adaptable to various environments and ideal for integrating diverse devices and systems, even in complex industrial settings.

The Arduino Opta™ acts as an OPC-UA server, exposing analog voltage readings and relay states as nodes that the Ignition platform (as the OPC-UA client) accesses. This setup enables dynamic data visualization on the HMI, where voltage levels and relay statuses are displayed in real time. While this application note focuses on reading commands, the OPC-UA protocol also supports sending commands from the HMI back to the Opta™, showcasing its potential for building interactive and responsive systems.

Key strengths of the OPC-UA protocol include:

- **Interoperability**: Standardized data exchange formats allow seamless integration with other OPC-UA-compliant devices and platforms, ensuring flexibility and scalability for future upgrades.
- **Security**: Features like encryption, authentication, and access control protect communication between the Opta™ and the Ignition platform from unauthorized access or tampering.
- **Scalability**: OPC-UA supports applications ranging from small-scale monitoring of single devices to large-scale industrial processes.

By leveraging OPC-UA, this solution offers a robust and efficient framework for monitoring and control. The integration of the Opta™ and the Ignition platform highlights the protocol’s advantages, including secure communication, seamless interoperability, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for modern industrial automation.

## OPC-UA Voltage Detection System Setup

This application does not require complex wiring for operation. However, the Arduino Opta™ must be connected to an appropriate power supply and an RJ45 Ethernet cable to establish the TCP/IP connection for OPC-UA communication with the Ignition platform. Ensure that the Ignition platform can detect and access the network address of the Arduino Opta™. Additionally, the Opta™ must be connected to a computer via a USB-C cable for initial setup and configuration.

![Voltage Detection System Setup](assets/setup.png)

The Opta™ reads the voltage level, controls relay outputs, and acts as an OPC-UA server. It organizes this data into structured nodes and makes it accessible via a TCP/IP connection to the Ignition platform, which functions as an OPC-UA client. The Ignition platform uses this data to create a Human-Machine Interface (HMI), enabling real-time monitoring of voltage levels and relay statuses.

Deployment Setup:
- **Arduino Opta™**: Connected to an analog voltage source for monitoring and powered by a 24 VDC power supply. The Opta™ reads voltage levels, controls relay outputs, and communicates with the Ignition platform via the OPC-UA protocol, acting as an OPC-UA server.
- **Ignition Platform**: Functions as an OPC-UA client, hosting the HMI for real-time visualization of voltage data and relay statuses. The platform also supports bidirectional communication with the Opta™, enabling control of the relays directly from the HMI.
- **Computer**: Used for the initial configuration of the Opta™, creating the design of the HMI in the Ignition Designer software, and running the HMI using the Ignition Vision software. The computer must be connected to the internet for firmware updates, library installations, and any required setup task.

## OPC-UA Voltage Detection System Overview

The Arduino Opta™, connected to an analog voltage sensor, acts as a central device for monitoring voltage levels. The voltage sensor captures field data and transmits it to the analog input of the Opta™, which processes it and acts as an OPC-UA server.

![Voltage Detection System Setup](assets/overview-setup.png)

The voltage readings are organized into structured nodes and transmitted via a TCP/IP connection using the OPC-UA protocol to the Ignition platform, which functions as an OPC-UA client. The Ignition platform hosts a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) that visualizes voltage data, allowing operators to monitor system performance and voltage levels effectively.

For initial configuration, the Opta™ must be connected to a computer via a USB-C cable. The computer is also used to set up the HMI in the Ignition Designer software, ensuring seamless communication between the Opta™ and the platform. This setup enables secure and efficient voltage monitoring in industrial environments.

### Opta™ Code

This code configures the Arduino Opta™ as an OPC-UA server, enabling seamless communication with the Ignition platform. The program reads voltage levels from an analog input, processes the data to classify it into predefined thresholds, and activates relays to control indicator lights corresponding to the voltage range. The data is transmitted to the Ignition platform via the OPC-UA protocol, allowing monitoring and interaction through an intuitive Human-Machine Interface (HMI).

The code can be downloaded [here](assets/opta-project-code.zip).

This section of the code establishes the foundational elements required for implementing the OPC UA protocol and additional functionalities in the Arduino Opta™ application. It begins by including essential libraries:

- `Arduino_OPC_UA` for OPC UA communication, enabling the Opta™ to act as an OPC UA server.
- `PortentaEthernet` for network connectivity.
- `OptaBlue` for handling Opta-specific features.

To ensure efficient operation, memory allocation for the OPC UA server is configured with a dedicated `stack` and `heap`. Key global variables are declared, including the OPC UA server instance (`UA_Server`), memory heap instance (`O1HeapInstance`), and pointers for managing the Opta™ device and its expansion modules.

Utility functions simplify input handling:

- `arduino_opta_analog_read()` reads analog voltage from a specified pin, converts it to a voltage value, and returns it as a `float`.
- `arduino_opta_digital_read()` interprets the analog voltage as a digital signal, returning either `HIGH` or `LOW` based on a voltage threshold.

Finally, the code redirects standard output to the Serial interface for debugging logs and development messages.

This section of the code is the `setup()` function, which initializes the Arduino Opta™ system and prepares it to operate as an OPC UA server. It begins by configuring serial communication at a baud rate of `115200`, primarily for debugging purposes.

The Ethernet interface is then initialized to establish network connectivity. If this step fails, the program enters an infinite loop, signaling a critical error. Upon successful Ethernet initialization, the code attempts to synchronize the Opta™’s onboard Real-Time Clock (RTC) with a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server to ensure accurate timestamps for OPC UA operations. If NTP synchronization is unsuccessful, it defaults to using the compilation date and time.

The Opta’s expansion module controller is initialized and updated to detect any connected expansion modules, enabling dynamic configuration for additional I/O capabilities. The code then allocates memory for the `OPC UA server` using the `o1heapInit` function, ensuring sufficient resources for server operations. If heap initialization fails, the program halts with an error message.

A new thread is started to run the OPC UA server. Within this thread, the server is created and configured to listen on the default OPC UA port, `4840`. The server’s IP address is logged for reference. The hardware variant of the Opta™ is identified and logged, and all analog input pins (A0 to A7) are pre-initialized for voltage readings with a 12-bit resolution for accurate measurement.

The code defines the Opta™ as an OPC UA object, exposing its analog inputs, digital inputs, and relay outputs as OPC UA nodes. These nodes allow external systems, such as the Ignition platform, to monitor and interact with the Opta’s inputs and outputs. Additionally, expansion modules, if detected, are dynamically exposed as OPC UA nodes, including their analog inputs, digital inputs, relay outputs, PWM channels, and LEDs.

Debugging information about thread stack usage and heap memory allocation is logged to monitor the system's resource utilization. Optional diagnostic information, such as heap and stack statistics, is also printed if enabled.

Finally, the `setup()` function configures the built-in LED pin as an output, providing visual feedback during operation. This comprehensive initialization ensures that the Arduino Opta™ is fully prepared for secure and efficient operation in industrial automation environments. It also sets the stage for seamless interaction with OPC UA clients, such as the Ignition platform, for monitoring and control purposes.

This section of the code defines the `loop()` function, which manages the continuous operation of the Arduino Opta™ system. It is responsible for updating the system’s state, managing connected expansion boards, handling communication, and executing periodic tasks to ensure smooth functionality as an OPC UA server.

The `loop()` begins by calling the `OptaController.update()` method, which refreshes the status of the Opta™ and its connected peripherals. This keeps the system synchronized and responsive to any changes in the connected hardware.

The function then checks the number of expansion boards connected to the Opta™. If the number exceeds the maximum supported expansions (`OPCUA_MAX_OPTA_EXPANSION_NUM`), it is capped at the allowable limit. Each detected expansion board is iterated over, and its digital outputs are updated based on the board type. Mechanical relay expansion boards are updated using the `updateDigitalOutputs()` method specific to their type, while solid-state relay boards are updated using their corresponding method. This ensures that all expansion modules operate reliably and stay in sync with the system.

A visual feedback mechanism is implemented by toggling the built-in LED on the Opta™ board every 500 milliseconds. This LED serves as a heartbeat signal, providing an indication that the device is running and the `loop()` is executing properly.

Every 5 seconds, the Opta™ logs its current IP address to the Serial Monitor using the OPC UA logging system. This provides ongoing confirmation of the device’s network connectivity and OPC UA server status, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

Finally, the `controlRelaysBasedOnVoltage()` function is called. This function handles logic for reading an analog voltage input and controlling the relays on the Opta™ to reflect voltage levels. This ensures that the relays are updated in real time based on the current analog input, enabling precise and dynamic control of the relays.

This `loop()` function is the operational backbone of the system, ensuring that the Opta™ remains up-to-date, responsive to inputs, and actively communicates with connected clients via the OPC UA protocol.

```arduino
void loop()
{
  /* Always call update as fast as possible */
  OptaController.update();

  /* Determine the number of expansion boards available and call update on them. */
  uint8_t opta_expansion_num = OptaController.getExpansionNum();
  if (opta_expansion_num > OPCUA_MAX_OPTA_EXPANSION_NUM)
    opta_expansion_num = OPCUA_MAX_OPTA_EXPANSION_NUM;
  /* Periodically call their respective update methods. */
  for(uint8_t i = 0; i < opta_expansion_num; i++)
  {
    ExpansionType_t const exp_type = OptaController.getExpansionType(i);
    if (exp_type == EXPANSION_OPTA_DIGITAL_MEC)
      reinterpret_cast<DigitalMechExpansion *>(OptaController.getExpansionPtr(i))->updateDigitalOutputs();
    else if (exp_type == EXPANSION_OPTA_DIGITAL_STS)
      reinterpret_cast<DigitalStSolidExpansion *>(OptaController.getExpansionPtr(i))->updateDigitalOutputs();
  }

  /* Toggle main LED signalling progress. */
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, !digitalRead(LED_BUILTIN));
  delay(500);

  /* Periodically print OPC UA server IP and port. */
  static auto prev_ip_print = millis();
  auto const now = millis();
  if ((now - prev_ip_print) > 5000)
  {
    UA_LOG_INFO(UA_Log_Stdout, UA_LOGCATEGORY_SERVER, "Arduino Opta IP: %s", Ethernet.localIP().toString().c_str());
    prev_ip_print = now;
  }

  controlRelaysBasedOnVoltage();
}
```

This part of the code implements the `controlRelaysBasedOnVoltage()` function, which dynamically manages the states of four relays based on the voltage level read from the analog pin `A4`. This pin corresponds to the voltage input on the Opta™ Kit PLC Trainer. The function integrates directly with the OPC UA server, updating the relay states in real time to ensure efficient communication and monitoring.

The function starts by reading the voltage from the analog input pin `A4` using the `arduino_opta_analog_read()` function. The measured voltage is stored in the variable `voltage`, which is the primary input for determining the state of each relay. Four boolean variables, `relay1State`, `relay2State`, `relay3State`, and `relay4State`, are initialized to `false`. These variables represent the states of each relay and will be updated based on the voltage level.

The function evaluates the voltage value against predefined thresholds to decide which relay should be activated. If the voltage is less than `0.3`, only `relay1State` is set to true. If the voltage is between `0.3` (inclusive) and `6.0` (exclusive), the function sets `relay2State` to true. For voltage levels between `6.0` (inclusive) and `8.0` (exclusive), `relay3State` is activated. Finally, if the voltage is `8.0` or higher, `relay4State` is set to true. This logic ensures that only one relay is active at a time, corresponding to the voltage range.

After determining the states, the function updates the relay states on the OPC UA server. For each relay, it initializes a `UA_Variant` object to hold the boolean state and assigns the respective relay state using the `UA_Variant_setScalar()` function. The `UA_Server_writeValue()` function is then used to update the value on the OPC UA server. The relays are mapped to specific numeric Node IDs: `50077` for `Relay 1`, `50078` for `Relay 2`, `50079` for `Relay 3`, and `50080` for `Relay 4`.

```arduino
static void controlRelaysBasedOnVoltage() {
    // Read the voltage from the analog pin A4
    float voltage = arduino_opta_analog_read(A4);

    // Variables to store relay states
    UA_Boolean relay1State = false;
    UA_Boolean relay2State = false;
    UA_Boolean relay3State = false;
    UA_Boolean relay4State = false;

    // Determine relay states based on voltage thresholds
    if (voltage < 0.3) {
        relay1State = true;
    } else if (voltage >= 0.3 && voltage < 6.0) {
        relay2State = true;
    } else if (voltage >= 6.0 && voltage < 8.0) {
        relay3State = true;
    } else {
        relay4State = true;
    }

    // Write relay states to the OPC UA server using Numeric Node IDs
    UA_Variant relayVariant;
    UA_Variant_setScalar(&relayVariant, &relay1State, &UA_TYPES[UA_TYPES_BOOLEAN]);
    UA_Server_writeValue(opc_ua_server, UA_NODEID_NUMERIC(0, 50077), relayVariant);

    UA_Variant_setScalar(&relayVariant, &relay2State, &UA_TYPES[UA_TYPES_BOOLEAN]);
    UA_Server_writeValue(opc_ua_server, UA_NODEID_NUMERIC(0, 50078), relayVariant);

    UA_Variant_setScalar(&relayVariant, &relay3State, &UA_TYPES[UA_TYPES_BOOLEAN]);
    UA_Server_writeValue(opc_ua_server, UA_NODEID_NUMERIC(0, 50079), relayVariant);

    UA_Variant_setScalar(&relayVariant, &relay4State, &UA_TYPES[UA_TYPES_BOOLEAN]);
    UA_Server_writeValue(opc_ua_server, UA_NODEID_NUMERIC(0, 50080), relayVariant);
}
```

This code turns an Arduino Opta™ into an OPC UA-compatible device, enabling real-time data monitoring and control via Ethernet. It initializes an OPC UA server, reads analog/digital inputs, controls relays based on voltage thresholds, and exposes device states as OPC UA nodes for external systems. The system supports expansion modules, synchronizes time using NTP, and provides real-time feedback through LEDs and logs.

The HMI, developed using the Ignition Platform, is a **Voltage Level Monitor** specifically designed for real-time monitoring and management of system voltage levels. The interface categorizes voltage states into **No Voltage**, **Safe Voltage**, **Alert Voltage**, and **Critical Voltage**, using clear color-coded indicators for immediate operator recognition. A dedicated Voltage Measurement section displays precise, real-time readings, while a **System Status** indicator ensures operators are informed of the system's operational state.

The gif below showcases the functionality of the Opta™ as it reads voltage from the analog input and activates the LED indicators based on the measured voltage levels. This visually represents the real-world application illustrated in the HMI.
