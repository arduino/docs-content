<Feature title="Configurability" image="configurability">

  All the eight available channels can be configured by software as analog input or analog output. Two of those channels can get 3 wires RTD readings and the expansions have four additional PWM outputs, with a user-defined output voltage configurable from 8 to 40 VDC using the V<sub>PWM</sub> terminal.
