The **Arduino Opta® Digital Expansion D1608E** and the **Arduino Opta® Digital Expansion D1608S** are plug-and-play extensions for the Opta® PLC controller, designed to enhance its functionality with additional inputs and outputs. These expansions come in two variants: the AFX00005 - Opta Ext D1608E (with electromechanical relays) and the AFX00006 - Opta Ext D1608S (with solid state relays), both fully compatible with the Arduino ecosystem.
