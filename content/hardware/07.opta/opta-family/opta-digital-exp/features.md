<Feature title="Product Printing Notice" image="security">

  A small quantity of units could have a small printing typo on its front text where the text "OUTPUT 1...8 (EMR 6A 250 V **DC** )" should claim "OUTPUT 1...8 (EMR 6A 250 V **ADC** )", **being the rated voltage of the Arduino Opta® Ext D1608E (AFX00005) relays 250 VAC**. Check the official datasheet of the product to know more about its technical specifications.
