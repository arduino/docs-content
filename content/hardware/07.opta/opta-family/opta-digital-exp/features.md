<FeatureDescription>

The **Arduino Opta® Digital Expansion D1608E** and the **Arduino Opta® Digital Expansion D1608S** are designed to multiply your Opta® micro PLC capabilities with the addition of 16 programmable inputs for connecting your digital sensors and 8 more relays to operate your machines.

Designed in partnership with leading relay manufacturer Finder®, it allows professionals to scale up industrial and building automation projects while taking advantage of the Arduino ecosystem.

Arduino Opta® Digital Expansions are available in two variants:

* AFX00005 - Arduino Opta® Ext D1608E: Electromechanical relay outputs
* AFX00006 - Arduino Opta® Ext D1608S: Solid State relay outputs

<Feature title="Product Printing Notice" image="security">

  A small quantity of units could have a small printing typo on its front text where the text "OUTPUT 1...8 (EMR 6A 250 V **DC** )" should claim "OUTPUT 1...8 (EMR 6A 250 V **ADC** )", **being the rated voltage of the Arduino Opta® Ext D1608E (AFX00005) relays 250 VAC**. Check the official datasheet of the product to know more about its technical specifications.
