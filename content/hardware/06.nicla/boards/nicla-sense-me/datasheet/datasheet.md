### Microcontroller
The Arduino® Nicla Sense ME is powered by a nRF52832 SoC within the ANNA-B112 module (MD1). The nRF52832 SoC is built around an Arm® Cortex®-M4 microcontroller with a floating point unit running at 64 MHz. Sketches are stored inside the nRF52832 internal 512 KB FLASH which is shared with the bootloader. 64 KB SRAM is available to the user. The ANNA-B112 acts as an SPI host for the data logging 2MB flash (U7) and the BHI260 6-axis IMU (U5). It is also the secondary for the BHI260 (U5) I2C and SPI connection. While the module itself runs at 1.8V, a level shifter can adjust the logic level between 1.8V and 3.3V depending on the LDO set in BQ25120 (U9). An external oscillator (Y1) provides a 32 KHz signal. 

### Bosch® BHI260 Smart Sensor System with Built-in 6-Axis IMU
The Bosch® BHI260 is an ultra-low power programmable sensor, combining a Fuser2 core processor, 6-axis IMU (gyroscope and accelerometer) together with a sensor fusion software framework. The BHI260 is a smart sensor core (hosting a programmable recognition system), that handles communication with other sensors on the **Arduino Nicla Sense ME** via I2C and SPI connections. There is also a dedicated 2MB Flash (U2) used to store execute-in-place (XiP) code as well as data storage, such as Bosch® sensor fusion algorithm (BSX) calibration data. The BHI 260 is capable of loading custom algorithms that can be trained on a PC. The generated smart algorithm then operates on this chip.

### Bosch® BME688 Environmental Sensor
The **Arduino Nicla Sense ME** is able to perform environmental monitoring via the Bosch® BME688 sensor (U6). This provides capabilities for pressure, humidity, temperature as well as Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) detection. The Bosch® BME688 performs gas detection via an eNose metal oxide semiconductor array with a typical gas scan cycle of 10.8 seconds.

### Bosch® BMP390 Pressure Sensor
Industrial grade accuracy and stability in pressure measurements are provided by the BMP390 (U3) designed for prolonged use, with a relative accuracy of ±0.03 hPa and an RMS of 0.02 Pa in high-resolution mode. The Bosch® BMP390 is suitable for rapid measurements with a sampling rate of 200 Hz, or for low-power use with a sampling rate of 1 Hz, consuming less than 3.2 µA. U3 is controlled via an SPI interface to the BHI260 (U2), on the same bus as the BME688 (U6).

### Bosch® BMM150 3-Axis Magnetometer
The Bosch® BMM150 (U4) provides accurate 3-axis measurements of the magnetic field with compass-level accuracy. Combined with the BHI260 IMU (U2), Bosch® sensor fusion can be used to obtain high-accuracy spatial orientation and motion vectors for the detection of heading in autonomous robots as well as predictive maintenance. There is a dedicated I2C connection to the BHI260 (U2), acting as the host.
### RGB LED

An I2C LED driver (U8) drives the RGB LED (DL1) and is capable of a maximum output of 40 mA. It is driven by the ANN-B112 (U5) microcontroller. 

### USB Bridge
The SAMD11 microcontroller (U1) is dedicated to act as both the USB bridge as well as the JTAG controller for the ANNA-B112. A logic level translator (U13) acts as an in-between to translate 3.3V logic to 1.8V for the ANNA-B112. The 3.3V voltage is generated from the USB voltage by an LDO (U14).

### Power Tree
![Nicla Sense ME Back View](assets/niclaSenseMEPowerTree.svg)

The **Arduino Nicla Sense ME** can be powered via micro USB (J7), ESLOV (J5) or VIN. This is converted into the relevant voltages via the BQ2512BAYFPR IC (U9). A Schottky diode provides reverse polarity protection to the USB and ESLOV voltages. When voltage is supplied via the micro USB, a linear 3.3V regulator also provides power to the SAMD11 microcontroller used for programming the board as well as for JTAG and SWD. The LED driver (U8) and RGB LEDs (DL1) are driven by a boost voltage of 5V. All other components operate off the 1.8V rail regulated by a buck converter. PMID acts as an OR switch between VIN and BATT and operates the LED driver. All I/O broken out to the pins are fed through a bi-directional voltage translator running at V<sub>DDIO_EXT</sub>. 

Additionally, the BQ25120AYFPR (U9) also provides support for a single cell 3.7V LiPo/Li-ion battery pack connected to J4, allowing the use of the board as a wireless sensor network. The battery charging current is set to 40mA with a termination current of 4mA (10%).
