<FeatureDescription>

The Arduino® Nicla Sense Env implements real-time environmental monitoring in a compact design. It integrates the ultra low-power **HS4001** temperature and humidity sensor, the **ZMOD4410** indoor air quality sensor for detecting volatile organic compounds (TVOC) and estimating CO₂, and the **ZMOD4510** outdoor air quality sensor for monitoring nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and ozone (O₃).

Powered by the **Renesas RA2E1 microcontroller**, it offers low-power performance, enabling **sensor networks** and scalable projects for environmental monitoring, automation, and IoT applications. The board is compatible with **Portenta, MKR, and other Arduino platforms**, making it ideal for **high-performance projects requiring sensor fusion**. With its onboard **ESLOV connector**, the Nicla Sense Env supports easy expansion and communication with other devices.

Designed for long-lasting, autonomous applications, it can be battery-powered for standalone operation, providing an excellent solution for environmental sensing with ultra-low power consumption.
