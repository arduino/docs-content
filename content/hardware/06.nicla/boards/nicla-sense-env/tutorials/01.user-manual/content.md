## First Use

### Unboxing the Product

Let's check out what is inside the box of the Nicla Sense Env board. Besides the board, you will find an ESLOV cable inside the box, which can connect the Nicla Sense Env with other supported Arduino boards with an onboard ESLOV connector (Portenta or MKR family boards). The board's MKR-styled pins can also connect the Nicla Sense Env to other supported Arduino boards (Nano family), but 2.54 mm header pins (not included) must be soldered to the MKR-styled board pins. 

![Unboxing the Nicla Sense Env](assets/user-manual-4.png)

**The Nicla Sense Env is not a standalone device but a shield for an Arduino-supported board from the Portenta, MKR, or Nano board families**. This user manual will use a Portenta C33 as the main or host board and the Nicla Sense Env as a shield or client board connected through the included ESLOV cable.

### Connecting the Board

As shown in the image below, the Nicla Sense Env can be connected to a Portenta or MKR family board using the onboard ESLOV connector and the included ESLOV cable. Alternatively, you can connect the Nicla Sense Env as a shield by using the MKR-style pins on the Portenta or MKR family boards.

![Connecting the Nicla Sense Env](assets/user-manual-23.png)

For other compatible boards, such as those from the Nano family, the Nicla Sense Env can also be connected using the 2.54 mm pins of the Nicla Sense Env board.

### Powering the Board

The Nicla Sense Env can be powered by:

- Using the onboard **ESLOV connector**, which has a dedicated +5 VDC power line regulated onboard to +3.3 VDC.
- Using an **external +3.3 VDC power supply** connected to the `VCC` pin (please refer to the [board pinout section](#pinout) of the user manual).

![Different ways to power the Nicla Sense Env](assets/user-manual-5.png)

***The Nicla Sense Env's `VCC` pin can be connected only to a +3.3 VDC power supply; any other voltage will permanently damage the board. Furthermore, the `VCC` pin does not have reverse polarity protection. Double-check your connections to avoid damaging the board.***

In this user manual, we will use the board's ESLOV connector to power it.

### Hello World Example

Let's control the Nicla Sense Env board to reproduce the classic `hello world` example used in the Arduino ecosystem: the `Blink`. We will use this example to verify the Nicla Sense Env's connection to the host board (a Portenta C33) via ESLOV, the host board's connection to the Arduino IDE, and that the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library and both boards, the shield and the host, are working as expected. This section will refer to the Nicla Sense Env as a shield or client. 

***We are using the API of the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library with the host board (Portenta C33) to control the Nicla Sense Env (shield).***

First, connect the shield to the host board via ESLOV, as shown in the image below, using an ESLOV cable (included with your Nicla Sense Env):

![Connecting the Nicla Sense Env to the host board via ESLOV](assets/user-manual-6.png)

Now, connect the host board to your computer using a USB-C® cable, open the Arduino IDE, and connect the host board to it. 

***If you are new to the Portenta C33, please refer to the board's [user manual](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-c33/user-manual/) for more detailed information.***

*/

// Include the NiclaSenseEnv library
#include "NiclaSenseEnv.h"

// Global device object for Nicla Sense Env
NiclaSenseEnv device;

/**
  Prints detailed device information to the Serial Monitor.
  This function outputs all critical system parameters including 
  the device I2C address, serial number, and other configuration settings.
*/
void printDeviceInfo() {
    Serial.println("- Device Information:");
    Serial.print("- Device (0x");
    Serial.print(device.deviceAddress(), HEX);
    Serial.println(") connected.");
    Serial.print("- Serial number: ");
    Serial.println(device.serialNumber());
    Serial.print("- Product ID: ");
    Serial.println(device.productID());
    Serial.print("- Software revision: ");
    Serial.println(device.softwareRevision());
    Serial.print("- Baud rate: ");
    Serial.println(device.UARTBaudRate());
    Serial.print("- CSV delimiter: ");
    Serial.println(device.CSVDelimiter());

    Serial.print("- Debugging enabled: ");
    if (device.isDebuggingEnabled()) {
        Serial.println("true");
    } else {
        Serial.println("false");
    }

    Serial.print("- CSV output enabled: ");
    if (device.isUARTCSVOutputEnabled()) {
        Serial.println("true");
    } else {
        Serial.println("false");
    }
}

void setup() {  
    // Initialize serial communication and wait up to 2.5 seconds for a connection
    Serial.begin(115200);
    for (auto startNow = millis() + 2500; !Serial && millis() < startNow; delay(500));

    if (device.begin()) {
        Serial.println("- Device successfully initialized!");
        // Print device information once after initialization
        printDeviceInfo();  
    } else {
        Serial.println("- Failed to initialize the device. Please check the connection!");
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Nothing to do here. All information is printed once in setup().
}
```

Here is a detailed breakdown of the `printDeviceInfo()` function and the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library API functions used in the `printDeviceInfo()` function:

- `deviceAddress()`: Retrieves the I<sup>2</sup>C address of the board. This is useful for identifying the board when multiple devices are connected to the same I<sup>2</sup>C bus.

        device.temperatureHumiditySensor().setEnabled(false);
        device.indoorAirQualitySensor().setEnabled(false);
        device.outdoorAirQualitySensor().setEnabled(false);

        // Check the onboard sensor states
        Serial.println("- Checking the sensor states...");
        Serial.print("- Temperature sensor enabled: ");
        if (device.temperatureHumiditySensor().enabled()) {
            Serial.println("true");
        } else {
            Serial.println("false");
        }

        Serial.print("- Indoor air quality sensor enabled: ");
        if (device.indoorAirQualitySensor().enabled()) {
            Serial.println("true");
        } else {
            Serial.println("false");
        }

        Serial.print("- Outdoor air quality sensor enabled: ");
        if (device.outdoorAirQualitySensor().enabled()) {
            Serial.println("true");
        } else {
            Serial.println("false");
        }
    } else {
        Serial.println("- Device could not be found. Please double-check the wiring!");
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Nothing to do here. All information is printed once in setup().
}
```

This example sketch initializes the Nicla Sense Env board, disables all onboard sensors and then checks and prints the status of each sensor on the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor.

Resetting the Nicla Sense Env is important for troubleshooting and ensuring the device operates cleanly. It is handy after making significant changes to the configuration or when an unexpected behavior occurs.

The example sketch below demonstrates how to reset the Nicla Sense Env using the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library API. It also shows how to verify that the board has been reset by turning off the temperature sensor before the reset and checking its status after the reset.

```arduino
/**
  Board Reset Example for Nicla Sense Env
  Name: nicla_sense_env_board_reset_example.ino
  Purpose: This sketch demonstrates how to reset the Nicla Sense Env 
  using the Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv library API and verifies the reset
  by disabling and then re-enabling the temperature sensor.
  
  @author Arduino Product Experience Team
  @version 1.0 31/05/24
*/

// Include the NiclaSenseEnv library
#include "NiclaSenseEnv.h"

// Global device object for Nicla Sense Env
NiclaSenseEnv device;

void setup() {
    // Initialize serial communication and wait up to 2.5 seconds for a connection
    Serial.begin(115200);
    for (auto startNow = millis() + 2500; !Serial && millis() < startNow; delay(500));

    if (device.begin()) {
        // Disable the temperature sensor
        Serial.println("- Disabling temperature sensor...");
        device.temperatureHumiditySensor().setEnabled(false);

        // Check the temperature sensor state before reset
        Serial.print("- Temperature sensor enabled before reset: ");
        if (device.temperatureHumiditySensor().enabled()) {
            Serial.println("true");
        } else {
            Serial.println("false");
        }

        // Resetting the device
        Serial.println("- Resetting the device...");
        device.reset();
        delay(2000);  // Ensure the device has enough time to reset properly

        // Check the temperature sensor state after reset
        Serial.print("- Temperature sensor enabled after reset: ");
        if (device.temperatureHumiditySensor().enabled()) {
            Serial.println("true");
        } else {
            Serial.println("false");
        }
    } else {
        Serial.println("- Device could not be found. Please double-check the wiring!");
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Nothing to do here. The device resets in setup().
}
```

This example shows that the temperature sensor, disabled before the reset, is re-enabled after the reset, confirming that the board has restarted and all settings have been reset to their defaults. Here is a detailed breakdown of the example sketch shown before and the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library API functions used in the sketch:

- `device.temperatureHumiditySensor().setEnabled(false)`: Disables the onboard temperature and humidity sensor.
- `device.reset()`: This function reboots the Nicla Sense Env, clearing all temporary settings.

After uploading the example sketch to the host board, you should see the following output in the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor:

![Example sketch output in the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor](assets/user-manual-11.png)

You can download the example sketch [here](assets/nicla_sense_env_board_reset_example.zip).

### Low Power Mode Management

Saving energy is vital for many projects, particularly those deployed in remote areas or with a limited power supply. The Nicla Sense Env supports a deep sleep mode that can help to minimize the board's power consumption.

***Deep sleep is essential for extending battery life and minimizing energy consumption when the board is not collecting data or performing tasks. It is necessary for battery-powered or power-constrained applications.***

The example sketch shown below demonstrates how to put the Nicla Sense Env board into deep sleep mode using the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library API: 

```arduino
/**
  Low Power Mode Management Example for Nicla Sense Env
  Name: nicla_sense_env_low_power_mode_example.ino
  Purpose: This sketch demonstrates how to put the Nicla Sense Env 
  into deep sleep mode using the Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv library API.
  
  @author Arduino Product Experience Team
  @version 1.0 31/05/24
*/

// Include the NiclaSenseEnv library
#include "NiclaSenseEnv.h"

// Global device object for Nicla Sense Env
NiclaSenseEnv device;

void setup() {
    // Initialize serial communication and wait up to 2.5 seconds for a connection
    Serial.begin(115200);
    for (auto startNow = millis() + 2500; !Serial && millis() < startNow; delay(500));

    if (device.begin()) {
        // Putting the device to sleep
        Serial.println("- Going to deep sleep mode...");
        device.deepSleep();
    } else {
        Serial.println("- Device could not be found. Please double-check the wiring!");
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Nothing to do here. The device is in deep sleep mode.
}
```

Here is a detailed breakdown of the example sketch shown before and the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library API functions used in the sketch:

- `device.deepSleep()`: This function puts the Nicla Sense Env board into a deep sleep state, minimizing power consumption to the lowest possible level.

After uploading the example sketch to the host board, you should see the following output in the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor:

![Example sketch output in the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor](assets/user-manual-12.png)

***Waking up a Nicla Sense Env board from deep sleep mode can only be done by a hardware reset.***

    if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 255) {
        // Change the direction of the fade
        fadeAmount = -fadeAmount;  
    }

    // Wait for a short time before updating the brightness again
    delay(30);
}
```

Here is a detailed breakdown of the example sketch shown before and the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library API functions used in the sketch:

- `device.begin()`: Initializes the Nicla Sense Env board, setting up communication with all onboard sensors and components, including the orange LED.
- `orangeLED.setBrightness(uint8_t brightness)`: Adjusts the brightness of the orange LED. The brightness ranges from `0` (off) to `255` (full brightness). In this sketch, the brightness gradually increases from `0` to `255` and then decreases back to 0, creating a smooth pulsing effect.
- `fadeAmount`: Controls the rate of change of brightness. When the brightness reaches either 0 or 255, the direction of change is reversed, making the LED brightness smoothly cycle up and down.

After uploading the example sketch to the Nicla Sense Env board, you should see the orange LED smoothly increase and decrease in brightness, creating a continuous pulsing effect.

### RGB LED

The onboard RGB LED on the Nicla Sense Env board can be controlled using the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library. The example sketch shown below shows how to turn on the LED with different colors and then turn it off using the `setColor()` and `setBrightness()` functions. The LED colors cycle continuously in the `loop()` function.

// Include the NiclaSenseEnv library
#include "Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv.h"

// Global device object for Nicla Sense Env
NiclaSenseEnv device;

void setup() {  
    // Initialize serial communication and wait up to 2.5 seconds for a connection
    Serial.begin(115200);
    for (auto startNow = millis() + 2500; !Serial && millis() < startNow; delay(500));

    if (device.begin()) {
        Serial.println("- Device successfully initialized!");
    } else {
        Serial.println("- Failed to initialize the device. Please check the connection!");
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Get the RGB LED object
    auto rgbLED = device.rgbLED();

    // Turn on the LED with red color
    rgbLED.setColor(255, 0, 0);  
    // Ensure maximum brightness, wait for one second
    rgbLED.setBrightness(255);   
    Serial.println("- RGB LED is now red!");
    delay(1000);

    // Turn on the LED with green color
    rgbLED.setColor(0, 255, 0);  
    // Ensure maximum brightness, wait for one second
    rgbLED.setBrightness(255);   
    Serial.println("- RGB LED is now green!");
    delay(1000);

    rgbLED.setBrightness(255);  
    Serial.println("- RGB LED is now blue!");
    delay(1000);

    // Set the LED color to black and brightness to 0 to turn it off
    rgbLED.setColor(0, 0, 0);    
    // Ensure minimum brightness, wait for one second
    rgbLED.setBrightness(0);
    Serial.println("- RGB LED is now off!");
    delay(1000); 
}
```

Here is a detailed breakdown of the example sketch shown before and the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library API functions used in the sketch:

- `device.begin()`: Initializes the Nicla Sense Env board, setting up communication with all onboard sensors and components, including the RGB LED.
- `rgbLED.setColor(uint8_t red, uint8_t green, uint8_t blue)`: This function sets the RGB LED to a specific color by specifying the intensity of the red, green, and blue components. Each value can range from `0` (off) to `255` (full brightness). In the example, the RGB LED cycles through red (255, 0, 0), green (0, 255, 0), and blue (0, 0, 255).
- `rgbLED.setBrightness(uint8_t brightness)`: Adjusts the brightness of the RGB LED. The value ranges from `0` (off) to `255` (full brightness). In the sketch, the brightness is set to 255 (maximum) when the LED is on, and to 0 (off) when the LED is turned off.

After uploading the example sketch to the Nicla Sense Env board, you should see the following output in the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor:

![Example sketch output in the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor](assets/user-manual-19.png)

You should also see the onboard RGB LED of your Nicla Sense Env board turn on red for one second, then green for one second, then blue for one second, and finally turn off, repeating this cycle.

## Indoor Air Quality Sensor 

The Nicla Sense Env board features an onboard air quality sensor, the ZMOD4410 from Renesas. The ZMOD4410 is a highly integrated digital gas sensor module for indoor air quality monitoring. It provides measurements of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), estimates CO₂ levels, and monitors indoor air quality (IAQ), making it suitable for applications such as smart home devices, air purifiers, and HVAC systems. Its compact size, low power consumption, and high sensitivity make this sensor an excellent choice for various air quality monitoring applications.

![The ZMOD4410 sensor of the Nicla Sense Env board](assets/user-manual-15.png)

***Every ZMOD sensor is electrically and chemically calibrated during Renesas production. The calibration data is stored in the non-volatile memory (NVM) of the sensor module and is used by the firmware routines during sensor initialization. ZMOD sensors are qualified for a 10-year lifetime (following the JEDEC JESD47 standard) without the need for recalibration.***

The example sketch below demonstrates how to read air quality data from the ZMOD4410 sensor using the `Arduino_NiclaSenseEnv` library API. The sketch reports indoor air quality values to the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor every 5 seconds.

**Important**: The ZMOD4410 supports several operation modes, each with specific sample rates and warm-up requirements. For IAQ measurements, the sensor can take a sample every three seconds but requires 60 warm-up samples, meaning a total warm-up time of 3 minutes. In ultra-low-power mode, the sensor can take samples every 90 seconds but requires only 10 warm-up samples, meaning it takes 15 minutes to fully warm-up.

## Outdoor Air Quality Sensor

The Nicla Sense Env board features an onboard outdoor air quality sensor, the ZMOD4510 from Renesas. The ZMOD4510 is a digital gas sensor module for outdoor air quality monitoring. It measures nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and ozone (O₃) levels. It calculates an outdoor air quality index (AQI), making it suitable for air quality monitoring stations, wearable devices, and smart city infrastructure applications. Its robustness, low power consumption, and high sensitivity make this sensor an excellent choice for outdoor air quality monitoring applications.

## Communication

The Nicla Sense Env board features a UART interface for data logging purposes. This allows the board to output sensor data in `CSV` format over UART, enabling easy data logging and monitoring in various applications. The UART interface is handy for scenarios where the board needs to communicate with other microcontrollers or systems without relying on USB connections.

The example sketch below demonstrates how to read data from the UART port on the Nicla Sense Env board. The sketch assumes the Nicla Sense Env is powered through the board's `VCC` pin or the ESLOV connector of a host board and connected to another board through the UART pins. The example also requires enabling the UART output on the Nicla Sense Env.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the example sketch shown before and the main functionalities of the UART communication on the Nicla Sense Env:

- First, the Nicla Sense Env needs to have its UART output enabled. This can be done by connecting to the board over I²C to a host board and running `device.begin()` and `device.setUARTCSVOutputEnabled(true, true)`.
- `Serial1.begin(38400, SERIAL_8N1)`: Initializes the `Serial1` port for UART communication with the specified baud rate and configuration.
- `processCSVLine()`: A function that processes a CSV line, maps the fields to their corresponding names and stores them in a map for easy access.
- The `loop()` function reads data from the UART port, processes the CSV data, and prints the parsed values to the Serial Monitor.
