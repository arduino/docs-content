The Arduino® Nicla Sense Env packs advanced environmental sensing in a compact form. The board it is intended to be used in conjunction with the **Portenta/MKR** family of SOM. It integrates the ultra low-power **HS4001** temperature and humidity sensor, the **ZMOD4410** for indoor air quality, and the **ZMOD4510** for outdoor air monitoring (NO₂, O₃). Powered by the **Renesas RA2E1 microcontroller** and featuring an **ESLOV connector**, it enables ultra low-power sensor networks for environmental applications. Compatible with Portenta, MKR, and other Arduino platforms, the Arduino Nicla Sense Env is ideal for scalable, high-performance projects requiring sensor fusion.
