#### Front

![Nicla Voice Front View](assets/front.svg)

### Microcontroller
The Arduino® Nicla Voice is powered by a nRF52832 SoC within the ANNA-B112 module (MD1). The nRF52832 SoC is built around an Arm® Cortex®-M4 microcontroller with floating point unit running at 64 MHz. Sketches are stored inside the nRF52832 internal 512 KB FLASH which is shared with the bootloader. 64 KB SRAM is available to the user. The ANNA-B112 acts as the SPI host for the data logging 16MB flash (U7). While the module itself runs at 1.8 V, a level shifter can adjust the logic level between 1.8 V and 3.3 V depending on the LDO set in BQ25120 (U9). An external oscillator (Y1) provides a 32 KHz signal. The ANNA-B112 acts as the SPI host for the data logging 16MB flash (U7) and the Syntiant® NDP120 IC (U3).

### Neural Decision Processor
The Arduino® Nicla Voice integrates a Neural Decision Processor™ NDP120 from Syntiant® (U3). The NDP120 leverages Syntiant Core 2™ ultra-low-power deep neural network inference engine to move larger neural networks into always-on domains with the capacity to run multiple applications simultaneously with minimal power consumption, including keyword spotting and event detection. The Syntiant® NDP120 IC (U3) also acts as the SPI host for the BMM150 3-axis magnetometer (U4) and the BMI270 6-axis IMU (U15).

### IMU
The Nicla Voice provides 9-axis IMU capabilities, by the combination of the 3-axis BMM150 (U4) and 6-axis BMI270 (U15) ICs. The BMI270 includes both a three-axis gyroscope as well as a three-axis accelerometer, while the BMM150 is capable of sensing magnetic field variations in all three dimensions. The information obtained can be used for measuring raw movement parameters as well as for machine learning. Both are connected via an SPI connection to the Syntiant® NDP120 IC (U3).

### RGB LED
An I2C LED driver (U8) drives the common anode RGB LED (DL1) and is capable of a maximum output of 40 mA. It is driven by the ANNA-B112 (U5) microcontroller.

### Microphone
The IM69D130V01XTSA1 microphone IC (U2) includes two near identical MEMS microphones with a common membrane. The audio signal is transported over a PDM channel to the NDP120 (U3). An external microphone can be added using the J6 connector, which is also connected to the NDP120 (U3) over a separate PDM channel. Internal microphone (U2) and optional external microphone (J6) are on PDM 0 and PDM 1 channels respectively. 

### USB Bridge
The SAMD11 microcontroller (U1) is dedicated to act as both the USB bridge as well as the JTAG controller for the ANNA-B112. A logic level translator (U13) acts as an in between to translate 3.3 V logic to 1.8 V for the ANNA-B112. The 3.3 V voltage is generated from the USB voltage by a LDO (U14).

### Power Tree
![Nicla Voice Power Tree](assets/niclaVoice_Power_Tree.png)

The **Arduino® Nicla Voice** can be powered via micro USB (J7), ESLOV (J5) or VIN pin. The input power is converted into the relevant voltages via the BQ2512BAYFPR IC (U9). A Schottky diode provides reverse polarity protection to the USB and ESLOV voltages. When voltage is supplied via the micro USB, a linear 3.3 V regulator also provides power to the SAMD11 microcontroller used for programming the board as well as for JTAG and SWD. The LED driver (U8) and RGB Leds (DL1) are driven by a boost voltage of 5V. All other components operate off the 1.8 V rail regulated by a buck converter. PMID acts as an OR switch between VIN and BATT and operates the LED driver. All I/O broken out to the pins are fed through a bi-direction voltage translator running at V<sub>DDIO_EXT</sub>.

Additionally, the BQ25120AYFPR (U9) also provides support for a single cell 3.7 V LiPo/Li-ion battery pack connected to J4, allowing the use of the board as a wireless sensor network.

## Board Operation
### Getting Started - IDE
If you want to program your Arduino® Nicla Voice while offline you need to install the Arduino® Desktop IDE **[1]**. To connect the Arduino® Nicla Voice to your computer, you’ll need a micro USB cable.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor
All Arduino® boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino® Cloud Editor **[2]**, by just installing a simple plugin. 

The Arduino® Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud
All Arduino® IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino® Cloud which allows you to log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Getting Started - ESLOV

The Nicla Voice board features an onboard ESLOV connector meant as an **extension** of the I2C communication bus; the board itself can act as a secondary ESLOV controller or peripheral. The ESLOV connector simplifies connecting various sensors, actuators, and other modules to the Nicla Voice without soldering or wiring.

 The ESLOV connector is a small 5-pin connector with a 1.00 mm pitch; the mechanical details of the connector can be found in the connector's datasheet.

The pin layout of the Nicla Voice ESLOV connector is the following:

1. VCC_IN (5V input)
2. INT
3. SCL
4. SDA
5. GND

The manufacturer part number of the ESLOV connector is SM05B-SRSS and its matching receptacle manufacturer part number is SHR-05V-S-B. 

**Note**: Pin 1 of the ESLOV connector of the Nicla Voice board is a **5V voltage input**, not a voltage output. This means that the Nicla Voice is intended to be used as a secondary or a peripheral board of a main board or controller with an ESLOV connector with a 5V output like, for example, the Portenta H7.

### Sample Sketches
Sample sketches for the Arduino® Nicla Voice can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino® IDE or in the “Documentation” section of the Arduino® Pro website **[4]**.

### Online Resources
Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on ProjectHub **[5]**, the Arduino® Library Reference **[6]** and the online store **[7]** where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.

### Board Recovery
All Arduino® boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB, it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after power up.

## Connector Pinouts
All the pins on J1 and J2 (excluding fins) are referenced to the V<sub>DDIO_EXT</sub> voltage which can be generated internally or supplied externally.
