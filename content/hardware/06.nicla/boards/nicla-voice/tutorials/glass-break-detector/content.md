## Edge Impulse and Nicla Voice Versatility

Edge Impulse and Nicla Voice provide a highly flexible and adaptable solution for various monitoring applications, including glass structure monitoring systems.

![Nicla Voice & Edge Impulse integration versatility](assets/nicla-implementation-scenario.png)

It can be integrated and trained to operate in:

- **Buildings:** Identify glass-breaking incidents in residential, commercial, or industrial properties. Alerts can trigger lockdown protocols, notify security teams, and log incidents in real time.

- **Vehicles:** Detect windshield breakage and provide real-time SOS signals, vehicle location, or license plate details. This feature is particularly beneficial for enhancing vehicle security.

- **Custom Environments:** Deploy in specific setups like public transportation, specialized labs, or sensitive equipment areas where glass-related incidents require immediate attention.

This adaptability provides comprehensive coverage and flexible response mechanisms for various scenarios. Additionally, integrating BLE communication and Arduino Cloud makes the system even more versatile and responsive.

***If you are new to the Nicla Voice, it is recommended that you review the [Nicla Voice User Manual](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nicla-voice/user-manual) to familiarize yourself with its features and setup before continuing with this application note.***

## Glass Break Machine Learning Model Development

The application will be based on a preconfigured example model created by Aurelien Lequertier that is available on the [Arduino Machine Learning Tools](https://mltools.arduino.cc/public/210541/latest).

This example detects anomalous sounds of glass breaking using the [DCASE rare sound events dataset](http://dcase.community/challenge2017/task-rare-sound-event-detection-results). With this example, you will learn how to build and deploy a glass-breaking detection system.

### Data Collection

Data collection is the foundation of any machine learning project. An existing dataset known as [**DCASE dataset** (Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events)](http://dcase.community/challenge2017/task-rare-sound-event-detection-results) will be used in this application note to avoid the practical challenges of recording actual glass-breaking sounds.

This dataset provides high-quality audio samples of glass-breaking sounds and background noise, which is essential for training and testing the model.

You will have *300 audio samples* for training and *54 samples* for testing. These samples represent two main categories:

- Glass-breaking events
- Non-glass-breaking ambient noise

Using the [**DCASE**](http://dcase.community/challenge2017/task-rare-sound-event-detection-results) dataset helps you to have a diverse range of audio conditions, improving the robustness of the final model.

The audio data was preprocessed with **Edge Impulse**. Its user interface allows you to manage audio files, including cropping unnecessary segments and splitting longer recordings into manageable pieces.

This preprocessing step ensures that only relevant data is provided into the training pipeline, maximizing the model's performance.

![Dataset Overview in Edge Impulse](assets/edge-dataset-overview.png)

The above image shows the dataset overview in Edge Impulse, where you can see the collected audio samples for glass-breaking events. The data is divided into training and testing sets to ensure the model's generalization.

Additionally, Edge Impulse allows you to collect data directly from your devices, either through a USB connection or wirelessly. This capability is particularly useful for iterative model improvement, allowing you to add new audio samples over time as real-world conditions change. This flexibility ensures that the model remains accurate and effective throughout its lifecycle.

### Data Processing

In this step, you will use an audio processing block optimized for the NDP120 processor found on the Nicla Voice. This block uses a *Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)* to convert audio data from the time domain to the frequency domain, helping in extracting meaningful features for classification.

Dimensionality reduction techniques visualize the features, describing different clusters for glass-breaking and non-glass-breaking sounds.

The image below shows the time series and audio processing block configuration in Edge Impulse. Configuring parameters like window size and frequency is important for extracting meaningful audio data features.

![Signal Processing Configuration](assets/edge-impulse-config.png)

The processing block provides configurable parameters such as window size and feature scaling, allowing you to fine-tune signal processing. This application note emphasizes the ease with which these configurations can be adjusted.

![Feature Generation and Visualization](assets/edge-generation-visualization.png)

In the image above, you can see the feature generation output. The data is visualized in clusters, which helps you understand the different features of the glass-breaking and non-glass-breaking classes.

### Model Training

You will use a dense neural network architecture that is well-suited for audio classification tasks. The configuration ensures compatibility with the hardware, using a 968-millisecond audio window for processing requirements.

Edge Impulse’s Eon tuner can automatically optimize model parameters, simplifying the process for you without extensive machine learning expertise.

The model achieved an accuracy of *89%* during training, showing its capability to differentiate between glass-breaking and background noises.

![Model Testing Results](assets/edge-model-test-result.png)

- **Architecture**: Dense neural network  
- **Window Size**: 968 milliseconds  
- **Optimization**: The **Eon tuner** automatically optimized signal processing and model parameters.  
- **Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of 89% on the training set, demonstrating robust performance. 

![Model Training Settings](assets/edge-model-training.png)

The image shows the training settings and the neural network architecture used in Edge Impulse. The Eon tuner can help you optimize hyperparameters like learning rate, number of neurons, and layer configurations to achieve the best balance between model size, accuracy, and latency.

### Model Testing

After training, the model is evaluated using a test dataset that includes previously unseen audio samples. This evaluation helps ensure the model generalizes adequately to new data and determine glass-breaking events under various conditions.

![Model Testing Results](assets/edge-model-test.png)

The image above shows the testing results with an accuracy of **99.12%**.

The confusion matrix highlights the model's capability to classify audio samples correctly while identifying potential areas for improvement.

Misclassifications mainly happened for short-duration glass-breaking sounds, suggesting the need for additional data or refinement of the processing pipeline to improve robustness. Regular updates to the dataset with new samples can address such limitations and improve performance.

***The model performance can be affected if the application is implemented in a very different environment than the one used for training. It is recommended that the datasets be provided with new samples and the model be retrained for a new and upgraded deployment.***

For a new model deployment, use the [Syntiant® uploader](assets/Syntiant_Uploader.zip) and replace the `ei_model.synpkg`, which you can find inside the downloaded folder with yours.

## Deployment

### Model Deployment

After training the model, it can be deployed to the Nicla Voice using **binary firmware builder from Edge Impulse**. This builder creates firmware that includes the trained model and the necessary scripts for on-device inference, allowing operation without internet connectivity.

To begin, navigate to the **Deployment** section in the Edge Impulse platform. The following image shows the deployment configuration screen, where you can select Nicla Voice as the deployment target.

![Configure Deployment for Nicla Voice](assets/edge-deployment-target.png)

Once the Nicla Voice is selected as the deployment target, click on **Build** to start the firmware build process. The animation below provides an overview of how this process looks:

![Deployment Build for Nicla Voice](assets/nicla-edge-impulse-fw-build-process.gif)

After the build is complete, the firmware files will automatically download. You can retrieve them later from the **Latest build** tab in the **Deployment** section if needed.

![Nicla Voice Firmware Build Files](assets/edge-fw-build.png)

The downloaded firmware comes as a compressed file. Extract it to your preferred directory. You will find several files in the extracted folder, including a directory named **`ndp120`**.

This folder contains the NDP120 processor firmware and the trained machine learning model. There are four scripts for each supported operating system:

- **flash_<os>:** Runs the MCU firmware and model flash scripts.
- **flash_<os>_mcu:** Flashes only the MCU firmware.
- **flash_<os>_model:** Flashes the NDP firmware, DSP firmware (if not present), and updates the model.
- **format_<os>_ext_flash:** Erases the external flash memory.

**`<os>`** refers to the operating system: linux, mac, or windows.

To install the required dependencies, run the `install_lib` script for your operating system. This script only needs to be run once. The model update process uses the Python package [`pyserial`](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

After preparing the firmware, connect the Nicla Voice to your computer. 

Use the corresponding script to automatically proceed with the firmware update and model upload. For Windows users, for example, the following command can be used in a terminal:

```bash
flash_windows
```

The animation below shows the firmware update process and uploading the trained model:

![Build & Flash for Nicla Voice](assets/nicla-edge-impulse-glass-break-detect-cmd.gif)

If you prefer to update manually, navigate to the **`ndp120`** directory and run the following commands in sequence:

```bash
./syntiant-uploader-win send -m "Y" -w "Y" -p COM<Port Number> mcu_fw_120_v91.synpkg
```

```bash
./syntiant-uploader-win send -m "Y" -w "Y" -p COM<Port Number> dsp_firmware_v91.synpkg
```

```bash
./syntiant-uploader-win send -m "Y" -w "Y" -p COM<Port Number> ei_model.synpkg
```

***If you are not familiar with updating the NDP120 processor firmware and uploading the trained machine learning model, please refer to [this section](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nicla-voice/user-manual/#ndp120-processor-firmware-update) of the Nicla Voice User Manual.***

### Running with Edge Impulse CLI

Once the Nicla Voice is updated with the firmware and model, you can run the trained glass-breaking detector model using the Edge Impulse CLI:

```bash
edge-impulse-run-impulse
```

If everything is set up correctly, the terminal will display information similar to the image below:

![Build & Flash for Nicla Voice](assets/edge-voice-window.png)

### Running with Arduino IDE

Alternatively, you can monitor the inference process using an Arduino script uploaded to the Nicla Voice.

Open the Arduino IDE and use the following example script to visualize results in the Serial Monitor:

```arduino
#include "NDP.h"

const bool lowestPower = false;

void ledBlueOn(char* label) {
  nicla::leds.begin();
  nicla::leds.setColor(blue);
  delay(200);
  nicla::leds.setColor(off);
  if (!lowestPower) {
    Serial.println(label);
  }
  nicla::leds.end();
}

void ledGreenOn() {
  nicla::leds.begin();
  nicla::leds.setColor(green);
  delay(200);
  nicla::leds.setColor(off);
  nicla::leds.end();
}

void ledRedBlink() {
  while (1) {
    nicla::leds.begin();
    nicla::leds.setColor(red);
    delay(200);
    nicla::leds.setColor(off);
    delay(200);
    nicla::leds.end();
  }
}

void setup() {

  Serial.begin(115200);
  nicla::begin();
  nicla::disableLDO();
  nicla::leds.begin();

  NDP.onError(ledRedBlink);
  NDP.onMatch(ledBlueOn);
  NDP.onEvent(ledGreenOn);
  Serial.println("Loading synpackages");
  NDP.begin("mcu_fw_120_v91.synpkg");
  NDP.load("dsp_firmware_v91.synpkg");
  NDP.load("ei_model.synpkg");
  Serial.println("packages loaded");
  NDP.getInfo();
  Serial.println("Configure mic");
  NDP.turnOnMicrophone();
  NDP.interrupts();

  // For maximum low power; please note that it's impossible to print after calling these functions
  nicla::leds.end();
  if (lowestPower) {
    NRF_UART0->ENABLE = 0;
  }
  //NDP.turnOffMicrophone();
}

void loop() {
  uint8_t command = 0xFF;

  while (Serial.available()) {
    command = Serial.read();
    if (command == 'f') {
      Serial.println("Interrupts disabled");
      NDP.noInterrupts();
    } else if (command == 'o') {
      Serial.println("Interrupts enabled");
      NDP.interrupts();
    }
  }
  //Serial.println("in the loop");
  delay(100);
}
```

## Glass Breaking Detection

With the firmware and model successfully deployed, you can simulate glass-breaking events by playing recorded sounds through a speaker or testing with real-world glass.

The trained model processes the sound in real-time and detects glass-breaking events, showing its capability.

***Although the sound of the real-world glass structure breaking presents the best method to test and validate the trained model, please take precautions and safety measures to avoid possible accidents or injuries.***

The Edge Impulse CLI provides real-time monitoring and classification results. The Arduino IDE Serial Monitor also allows you to observe the same information.

Below is an example of a real-time glass break classification result:

![Live Inference Classification (CLI)](assets/edge-glass-break-model.gif)

You can also use the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor to observe similar results found within the Edge Impulse CLI.

![Live Inference Classification (Arduino IDE)](assets/nicla-edge-impulse-glass-break-detect.gif)

## Expanding Glass Breaking Detector

You can expand the Glass Breaking Detector system described in this application note to include real-time alerts and interesting automation by integrating the Nicla Voice, Portenta H7 and the Arduino Cloud.

![Possible expanded glass break detection system](assets/nicla-vehicle-install.png)

This enhancement allows for scalable solutions designed for environments such as buildings or other closed spaces with simple yet helpful monitoring and safety features, for example.

### Expanded System Overview

The system begins with the Nicla Voice, which runs a trained machine learning model to detect glass-breaking sounds. Here you will use the model discussed in the [Machine Learning Model Development](#machine-learning-model-development) section, providing a nice foundation for real-world implementations in controlled environments.

Upon recognizing such an event, the Nicla Voice sends a notification via Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE) to the Portenta H7.

![Expanded glass break detection system overview](assets/nicla-edge-overall-system-flow.png)

The Portenta H7 is the host device, bridging the detection hardware with the Arduino Cloud. It receives the BLE notification, processes the alert, and updates the cloud dashboard in real-time.

In addition, it provides an action-based response system that can be customized to comply with the required standards if needed:

- **Security Alert Call:** It is activated upon recognizing the first glass-breaking event. This is to provide an immediate warning that a critical event may have occurred, enabling early intervention.

- **Lockdown Motor:** It is triggered if additional glass-breaking events are detected, escalating the response by activating mechanisms such as reinforced shutters to secure the environment.

This example shows a possible practical example of how the system can be applied to monitor and safeguard buildings or enclosed areas with an escalation mechanism. The approach combines simplicity and adaptability, ensuring the system can address specific needs while providing reliable and responsive features.

### Nicla Voice Integration

The Nicla Voice identifies glass-breaking sounds and communicates alerts to the Portenta H7 via BLE.

When the Nicla Voice recognizes a glass-breaking sound, it triggers the **`sendAlert`** function to notify the Portenta H7. The following code shows how part of the alert mechanism works:

```arduino
void sendAlert(char* label) {
  if (strcmp(label, "NN0:glassbreak") == 0) {
    Serial.println("Glass break detected. Sending BLE alert...");

    // Write to BLE characteristic
    glassBreakAlert.writeValue(1); 
    NDP.noInterrupts();
    nicla::leds.begin();
    nicla::leds.setColor(red);
    delay(3000);
    nicla::leds.end();
    NDP.interrupts();
  } else {
    Serial.println("No relevant event detected.");
  }
}
```

This part of the code ensures that the Nicla Voice communicates detected events to the host device, allowing you to have rapid responses. In this case, the function ensures the Nicla Voice can notify the Portenta H7 as soon as a glass-breaking sound is detected.

The full implementation of the Nicla Voice includes the BLE setup, NDP configuration, and event handling routines. The complete code for the Nicla Voice for Arduino IDE is as follows:

```arduino
/**

### Portenta H7 Integration

The Portenta H7 is responsible for processing BLE notifications from the Nicla Voice and interfacing with the Arduino Cloud. It interprets alerts and manages the system's response through cloud updates and hardware control routines with event level details.

The following code snippet shows how the Portenta H7 processes these specific alerts:

```arduino
if (AlertValue == 1) {
    alertStatus = true; // General alert status triggered
    if (!SecurityAlert) {
        SecurityAlert = true; // Turn on security alert
        GlassEvent = "Security Alert ON: Glass break detected";
        Serial.println("Security Alert activated.");
    } else {
        LockdownMotor = true; // Turn on lockdown motor
        GlassEvent = "Lockdown activated: Additional glass break detected";
        Serial.println("Lockdown motor activated.");
    }
}
```

- **Initial Alert:** When the first glass-breaking event is detected, the system sets `SecurityAlert` to `true`. This activates the **Security Alert Call** orutine, warning connected users or systems via the cloud dashboard.

- **Escalated Alert:** If further glass-breaking events occur, the system sets `LockdownMotor` to `true`, activating physical mechanisms like shutters to secure the environment.

The logic exemplifies how the subsequent events escalated appropriately, providing a dynamic and layered response to potential threats and handle possible complex scenarios.

The full implementation for the Portenta H7 includes BLE initialization, Cloud updates, and response routines. The complete code for the Portenta H7 is as follows:

```arduino
/**
  Glass-Breaking Detection Using Edge Impulse & Nicla Voice

  This code sets the Portenta H7 to behave as a host for receiving BLE notifications
    from the Nicla Voice and forwarding real-time glass-breaking event data to the
    Arduino Cloud. The system escalates responses based on the received alerts,
    activating a Security Alert and optionally triggering a Lockdown Motor.

### Arduino Cloud Integration

By integrating the system with the Arduino IoT Cloud, you will have the access to a centralized dashboard that provides real-time monitoring and control of your Glass Breaking Detector system.

In this example, you can view real-time event logs, track BLE connection status, and observe the *Security Alert* or *Lockdown* activation:

- **Real-Time Event Monitoring:** The dashboard logs and displays events as they occur, allowing you to stay informed about glass-breaking incidents.
- **Connection Status:** The BLE connection status between the Nicla Voice and Portenta H7 is shown, to provide present system operation.
- **Security Alert and Lockdown Mechanism Indicators:** You can monitor the activation status of the *Security Alert* and *Lockdown* mechanism directly from the dashboard.
