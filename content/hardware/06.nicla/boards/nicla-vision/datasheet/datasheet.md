### Processor

The Nicla Vision's main processor is the dual-core STM32H747 (U1), which includes a Cortex® M7 running at 480 MHz and a Cortex® M4 running at 240 MHz. The two cores communicate via a Remote Procedure Call mechanism, which allows functions to be called on the other processor seamlessly.

### 6-Axis IMU

It is possible to obtain 3D gyroscope and 3D accelerometer data from the LSM6DSOX 6-axis IMU (U3). In addition to providing such data, machine learning on the IMU for gesture detection can be done, offloading computation load from the main processor.

### Wi-Fi®/Bluetooth® Connectivity

The Murata® LBEE5KL1DX-883 wireless module (U9) simultaneously provides Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® connectivity in an ultra-small package based on the Cypress CYW4343W. The IEEE802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi® interface can be operated as an access point (AP), station (STA) or dual-mode simultaneous AP/STA. It supports a maximum transfer rate of 65 Mbps. Bluetooth® interface supports Bluetooth® Classic and BLE. An integrated antenna circuitry switch allows a single external antenna (J6) to be shared between Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth®.

### Crypto Capabilities

The Arduino® Nicla Vision enables IC-level edge-to-cloud security capability through the NXP SE050C2 Crypto chip (U8). This provides Common Criteria EAL 6+ security certification up to OS level, RSA/ECC cryptographic algorithm support, and credential storage.

### Time of Flight Sensor

The VL53L1CBV0FY Time-of-Flight sensor (U4) adds accurate and low power ranging capabilities to the Arduino® Nicla Vision. The invisible near-infrared VCSEL laser (including the analog driver) is encapsulated with receiving optics in an all-in-one small module below the camera.

### Digital Microphones

The MP34DT05 digital MEMS microphone is omnidirectional and operates via a capacitive sensing element with a high (64 dB) signal-to-noise ratio. The sensing element, capable of detecting acoustic waves, is manufactured using a specialized silicon micromachining process dedicated to producing audio sensors (U6).

### Power Tree

![Nicla Vision Power Tree](assets/niclaVisionPowerTree.svg)

Input voltage can be provided to the Nicla Vision through the USB connector (J7), the ESLOV connector (J5), the battery connector (J4) or the headers. The USB connector is prioritized over the ESLOV connector, both of which are prioritized over the battery connector and header. Reverse polarity protection for the USB connector (J7) and the ESLOV connector (J5) is provided by ideal diodes U2 and U7 respectively. Input voltage from the battery does NOT have reverse polarity protection and the user is responsible for respecting the polarity.

An NTC (negative thermal coefficient) sensor provides overtemperature shutoff to the battery. The battery fuel gauge provides an indication of the remaining battery capacity.

There are three main power lines provided:

- **+3V1** provides power to the microprocessor (U1), 25 MHz oscillator (U14), 32.768 kHz oscillator (Y1), USB transceiver (U5) and Wi-Fi®/Bluetooth® module.
- **+2V8A** provides power to the camera (M1) and time-of-flight sensor (U4)
- **+1V8** provides power to the microprocessor (U1), camera (M1), USB transceiver (U5), Wi-Fi®/Bluetooth® module (U9), accelerometer (U3), microphone (U6), crypto (U8), FLASH (U13), 27 MHz oscillator (U15) as well as the two level translators (U11, U12).

- Additionally, a dedicated analog supply rail (VDDA) is provided for the microcontroller (U1). The camera module (M1) also has a dedicated power rail (+1V8CAM).

## Board Operation

### Getting Started - IDE

If you want to program your Arduino® Nicla Vision while offline, you need to install the Arduino® Desktop IDE **[1]**. To connect the Arduino® Vision to your computer, you will need a micro USB cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor

All Arduino® boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino® Cloud Editor **[2]** by installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino® Cloud Editor is hosted online. Therefore, it will always be up-to-date with all the latest features and support of the boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding in the browser and upload your sketches to your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud

All Arduino® IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino® Cloud, which allows you to log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Getting Started - WebBLE

The Arduino Nicla Vision provides the capability for OTA updates to the STM32 microcontroller using WebBLE.

### Getting Started - ESLOV

This board can function as a secondary to an ESLOV controller and update the firmware through this method.

### Sample Sketches

Sample sketches for the Arduino® Nicla Vision can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino® IDE or on the Arduino® documentation website **[4]**

### Online Resources

Now that you have learned the basics of what you can do with the board, you can explore its endless possibilities by checking out exciting projects on ProjectHub **[5]**, the Arduino® Library Reference **[6]**, and the online store **[7]**, where you can complement your board with sensors, actuators, and more.

### Board Recovery

All Arduino® boards have a built-in bootloader, which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is no longer reachable via USB, it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after a power-up.

## Connector Pinouts

**Note 1:** All the pins on J1 and J2 (excluding fins) are referenced to the V<sub>DDIO_EXT</sub> voltage which can be generated internally or supplied externally.
**Note 2:** I2C1 is connected to the level translator U12 which has internal 10k pullups. R9 and R10 pull-up resistors are not mounted on the board.
