The Arduino速 Nicla Vision is a ready-to-use, standalone camera for analyzing and processing images on the edge. Thanks to its 2 MP color camera, smart 6-axis motion sensor, integrated microphone and distance sensor, it is suitable for asset tracking, object recognition and predictive maintenance. Quickly implement sensor nodes to send collected data to the Arduino速 Cloud (or third-party vendor services) via integrated Wi-Fi速/Bluetooth速 LE connectivity.
