## Overview

In this tutorial you will use the Nicla Vision to detect proximity, thanks to the Time of Flight (ToF) sensor **VL53L1X**.

This tutorial teaches you how to create a sketch that will blink the built-in RGB LED and control the speed of its blink with the proximity values. It can be useful for future projects where there is the need to control the camera only when something is detected in front of the sensor. 

## Goals

- Set up the needed libraries
- Learn how to interact with the proximity readings
- Change the RGB values of the LED

### Required Hardware and Software

- [Nicla Vision](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nicla-vision)
- VL53L1X library (Available in the Library Manager)

## Instructions

### Time of Flight Sensor

![Arduino Nicla Vision - Time of Flight sensor](assets/nicla-vision-tof.png)

To make sure that the sketch works properly, the latest versions of the **Arduino Mbed OS Nicla** core and the **VL53L1X library** need to be installed. Both can be found inside the Arduino IDE.

- The **Arduino Mbed OS Nicla** core can be found in the **boards manager...**  
- The **VL53L1X library** can be found in the **Library manager** 

If you are using version 2.2.0 or later of the Arduino IDE, install the VL53L1X library as follows:

- In the left bar of the Arduino IDE, click on the **Library Manager**.
- Search for **VL53L1X**.
- Click the VL53L1X entry in the list, authored by Pololu.
- Click **Install**. More detailed instructions on how to install a library can be found [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/ide-v2-installing-a-library/).


### Include the Needed Libraries and Objects Declaration

First of all, declare the sensor's class so you can access it later on in your sketch. You can use variables to control the time elements in the sketch. This will make sure that the readings stay accurate over time.

```arduino
#include "VL53L1X.h"
VL53L1X proximity;

bool blinkState = false;
int reading = 0;
int timeStart = 0;
int blinkTime = 2000;
```

### Initialize the Proximity Sensor and the LED

Inside the setup you need to initialize and configure the proximity sensor. Also, the RGB LED needs to be set as an output to make it light up and enable you to change its behavior.

***The LEDs are accessed in the same way as on the Portenta H7: LEDR, LEDG and LEDB.***

```arduino
  void setup(){
    Serial.begin(115200);
    Wire1.begin();
    Wire1.setClock(400000); // use 400 kHz I2C
    proximity.setBus(&Wire1);
    
    pinMode(LEDB,OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(LEDB, blinkState);
    
    if (!proximity.init()){
      Serial.println("Failed to detect and initialize sensor!");
      while (1);
    }

    proximity.setDistanceMode(VL53L1X::Long);
    proximity.setMeasurementTimingBudget(10000);
    proximity.startContinuous(10);
  }
```

***Make sure you initialize `Wire1`, set the clock speed to 400 kHz and set the bus pointer to `Wire1`. It will not work if you do not add these settings.***

### Control the Speed of the Blink

The sketch is going to get the reading on every loop, store it and then the state of the LED will change until the time is up and another proximity reading is taken.

```arduino
  void loop(){
    reading = proximity.read();
    Serial.println(reading);

    if (millis() - timeStart >= reading){
      digitalWrite(LEDB, blinkState);
      timeStart = millis();

      blinkState = !blinkState;
    }
  }
```

### Complete Sketch

```arduino
#include "VL53L1X.h"
VL53L1X proximity;

bool blinkState = false;
int reading = 0;
int timeStart = 0;
int blinkTime = 2000;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Wire1.begin();
  Wire1.setClock(400000); // use 400 kHz I2C
  proximity.setBus(&Wire1);


  pinMode(LEDB, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(LEDB, blinkState);

  if (!proximity.init()) {
    Serial.println("Failed to detect and initialize sensor!");
    while (1);
  }

  proximity.setDistanceMode(VL53L1X::Long);
  proximity.setMeasurementTimingBudget(10000);
  proximity.startContinuous(10);
}

void loop() {
  reading = proximity.read();
  Serial.println(reading);

  if (millis() - timeStart >= reading) {
    digitalWrite(LEDB, blinkState);
    timeStart = millis();

    blinkState = !blinkState;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we went through how to get readings from the ToF sensor and how to use these readings to change how the built-in LED behaves. At the end of the tutorial you can also find a reference list for the ToF library.
