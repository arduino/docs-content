In this tutorial you will learn how to access the EEPROM (memory) on an **Arduino UNO R4 Minima** board. The EEPROM is embedded in the UNO R4 Minima's microcontroller (RA4M1).

## Goals

The goals of this tutorials are:

- Write to the EEPROM memory,
- Read from the EEPROM memory.

## Hardware & Software Needed

- Arduino IDE ([online](https://create.arduino.cc/) or [offline](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)) 
- USB-C cable 
- [Arduino UNO R4 Minima](/hardware/uno-r4-minima)
- [UNO R4 Board Package](/tutorials/uno-r4-minima/minima-getting-started)

## EEPROM

Electronically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) is a memory that can be used to store data that can be retrieved after power loss. This memory can be effective to use during run-time to log data that can be used to re-initialize whenever a system comes back online.

The Arduino Uno R4 Minima has 8 kB of EEPROM.

When writing to the EEPROM memory, we specify two parameters: the **address** and **value**. Each byte can hold a value between 0-255.

```arduino
EEPROM.write(0,15); //writes the value 15 to the first byte
```

We are writing a value of `15` to the first byte available in the memory, `0`.

To read the value of this memory, we simply use:

```arduino
EEPROM.read(0); //reads first byte
```

There are several more methods available when working with EEPROM, and you can read more about this in the [A Guide to EEPROM](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/programming/eeprom-guide).

***Please note: EEPROM is a type of memory with limited amount of write cycles. Be cautious when writing to this memory as you may significantly reduce the lifespan of this memory.***

### EEPROM Write 

A minimal example on how to **write** to the EEPROM can be found below:

```arduino
#include <EEPROM.h>

int addr = 0;
byte value = 100; 

void setup() {
  EEPROM.write(addr, val);
}
void loop(){ 
}
```

### EEPROM Read

A minimal example on how to **read** from the EEPROM can be found below:

```arduino
#include <EEPROM.h>

int addr = 0;
byte value;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  value = EEPROM.read(addr);
  while (!Serial) {
    
  }

  Serial.print("Address 0: ");
  Serial.println(addr);
}

void loop() {
}
```
