<FeatureDescription>

The Yún Rev2 has the power of a Linux based system that enables advanced network connections and applications. Connecting to your Wi-Fi or wired network is simple thanks to the Yún Web Panel and the dedicated **YunFirstConfig** sketch. The Web panel allows you to manage your shield preferences and upload your sketch. The Yún Rev2 uses the Bridge library and so extends the board capabilities by using the Linux processor.
