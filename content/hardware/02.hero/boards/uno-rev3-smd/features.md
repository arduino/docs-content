<FeatureDescription>

Arduino UNO SMD is a microcontroller board based on the **ATmega328P**. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.

The "SMD" stands for surface-mount device, and the microcontroller (ATmega328p) is soldered directly to the board.
