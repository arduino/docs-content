The Arduino UNO R4 WiFi is designed around the 32-bit microcontroller RA4M1 from [Renesas](https://www.renesas.com/us/en) while also featuring a ESP32 module for Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® connectivity. Its distinctive 12x8 LED matrix makes it possible to prototype visuals directly on the board, and with a Qwiic connector, you can create projects plug-and-play style.
