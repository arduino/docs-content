The Arduino UNO R4 WiFi comes with a built-in ESP32-S3 module that enables Wi-Fi® functionality. This also means you can use it with the Arduino Cloud!

This article shows you how to set up your board and connect it to the Cloud allowing you to upload code over the air, create dashboards to monitor your data and control your Arduino board remotely.

## Software & Hardware Needed

- [Arduino UNO R4 WiFi](https://store.arduino.cc/uno-r4-wifi)
- [Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/home/)

## Setup and Process

***If you are new to the Arduino Cloud before check out [Getting Started With the Arduino Cloud](/arduino-cloud/getting-started/iot-cloud-getting-started).***

To use the Arduino Cloud you will need to register and set up a **free** account. 

### Configure Your Board

After you have set up your account you can connect your board to your pc. Inside the Cloud Things overview click on **Create**.

This will take you to the setup menu for creating your Thing. Here you can set up your device, configure your network connection and add Cloud variables. You can learn more about Cloud variables in [Getting Started With the Arduino Cloud](/arduino-cloud/getting-started/iot-cloud-getting-started). First, under associate device, click on **Select Device**.

If this is your first time using the Arduino Cloud you will be asked to download the **Arduino Create Agent**. The Create Agent is a piece of software that is necessary for your Arduino board to communicate with your browser. Download and install it by clicking on download and following the installation process.
