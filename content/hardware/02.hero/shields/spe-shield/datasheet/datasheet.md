### Getting Started - IDE

To program your Portenta Mid Carrier Proto Shield offline with a Portenta family board, install the Arduino Desktop IDE **[1]**. You will need a compatible USB cable to connect the Portenta board to your computer.

### Getting Started - Arduino Web Editor

All Arduino devices work out of the box on the Arduino Cloud Editor **[2]** by installing a simple plugin. The Arduino Cloud Editor is hosted online. Therefore, it will always be up-to-date with all the latest features and support for all boards and devices. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your device.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud

All Arduino IoT-enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud, which allows you to log, graph, and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business. Refer to the official documentation for more details.

### Sample Sketches

Sample sketches for the Portenta Mid Carrier Proto Shield are available in the **Examples** menu in the Arduino IDE or the **Portenta Mid Carrier Proto Shield Documentation** section of Arduino documentation **[4]**.

### Online Resources

Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the device, you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on Arduino Project Hub **[5]**, the Arduino Library Reference **[6]**, and the online store **[7]** where you will be able to complement your Portenta Mid Carrier Proto Shield board with additional extensions, sensors, and actuators.
