### Single Pair Ethernet (SPE)
  
Single Pair Ethernet (SPE) enables Ethernet communication over a single twisted pair of wires, reducing cabling complexity without sacrificing performance in IoT and industrial applications.

**Key Features**  
- **Speed:** Operates at **10 Mbps** under the 10BASE-T1S standard.  
- **Maximum Distance:** Supports up to **25 meters** in multidrop topology (multiple nodes on a single segment).  
- **Topology:** Allows up to 8 nodes in a multidrop network.  
- **Applications:** IoT devices, sensors, and controllers for industrial automation.  

**SPE Implementation in the Arduino UNO SPE Shield**  
- **Ethernet PHY IC:** The shield uses a 10BASE-T1S PHY, which supports multidrop communication and noise suppression.
  - Includes onboard common-mode chokes to filter high-frequency interference.
- **Connection Points:**
  - **Screw Terminals** for single pair wiring.
  - **Dedicated SPE Connector** for robust direct connections to compatible devices.  
- **Jumper Configuration:** Termination resistors are configurable:
  - **Point-to-Point Setup:** Use jumpers to enable the termination at endpoints for proper signal integrity.
  - **Multidrop Setup:** Terminations are disabled internally; only the furthest nodes in the network should be terminated.  
  - **Detailed Setup:** For nodes at the **start or end of the network**, activate the onboard termination closing by jumpers, ensuring proper impedance matching. Intermediate nodes should leave the jumper unconnected.
- **PoDL (Power over Data Line):** Capable of transmitting power (+7-24 VDC) along with data on the same pair of wires.


<div style="background-color: #FFFFE0; border-left: 6px solid #FFD700; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
  <strong>Node Distance:</strong> Each node should maintain a maximum distance of <strong>5 cm</strong> from the bus to ensure stable communication and signal integrity.
</div>

#### Connection Recomendations

When using the UNO SPE Shield screw terminals to wire the 10BASE‑T1S network you must meet the following recomendations:

- The cable used must be a twisted pair.
- The maximum lenght of the multidrop mixing segment of the bus must be ≤ 25 m.
- The multidrop mode can support up to 8 nodes on one mixing segment.
- On a multidrop configuration, the stub distance must be ≤ 5 cm.

![Wiring configuration to meet the SPE standard](assets/wiring.png)

- Short the termination jumpers on the first and last nodes of the SPE bus.

![Termination usage on SPE networks with the UNO SPE Shield](assets/jumpers.png)

#### Interoperability Between RS-485 and SPE

The shield supports simultaneous operation of RS-485 and SPE protocols.  
- **Electrical Isolation:** Both systems are decoupled via onboard filters and protection circuits, preventing interference.  
- **Practical Design Considerations:** To maximize performance, use short, high-quality cables for both protocols, adhering to recommended lengths and shielding practices.

### RS-485

RS-485 is a robust communication protocol designed for industrial settings. It features differential signaling that ensures noise immunity and reliability over long distances. 

**Key Features**  
- **Speed:** Up to **20 Mbps** for short distances (<15 m).  
- **Maximum Distance:** Supports up to 1,200 meters with reduced speeds.  
- **Topology:** Works in a bus topology, supporting up to 80 nodes.  
- **Applications:** Commonly used in industrial automation (PLCs, HVAC systems, motor controllers).  

**RS-485 Implementation in the Arduino UNO SPE Shield**  
- **RS-485 Driver IC:** The shield uses an XR33058IDTR-F transceiver, which manages signal transmission and reception with high noise tolerance.
  - Includes support for fail-safe biasing (ensuring stable idle-state signals).
- **Connection Points:** RS-485 screw terminals allow direct wiring of RS-485 devices.  
- **Termination:** Includes a 120 Ω termination jumper to match the bus impedance.  
  - Proper termination minimizes signal reflections, critical for long-distance communication stability.
