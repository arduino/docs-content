Here you will find the technical specifications for the Arduino Nesso N1.

**Note on Connectors:** The Qwiic, and 8-pin expansion port connectors operate at **3.3 V**. Connecting modules or devices that use higher logic levels, such as 5 V, may permanently damage the board.

**Note on GPIO Current:** Be mindful of the current limits for the GPIO pins. Exceeding the specifications in the ESP32-C6 datasheet may damage the pin or the board.
