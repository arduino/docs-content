## About This Project

**Train your cat with the help of the Arduino Cloud!**

If you ever tried to train a cat, you know how hard it is. Cats are their own masters, but now you have the chance to let the cats do your bidding using this IoT-enabled device.

**Welcome to Pavlov's Cat Experiment!**

In this project, you will learn how to teach your cat when it is (and isn't) dinner time using nothing but the components in the IoT Bundle and some cardboard.

And we all know that cats already love cardboard boxes! Every time the cat hears a certain melody, it receives food. A light sensor detects the presence of a cat.

Another melody does nothing. See how this will work? You will be able to monitor your cat's progression over time and set the food dispensing rate from your phone.

**Disclaimer:** **No cats were hurt in the development of this experiment. Also, no guarantee that the cat will eat the food, but you get the picture, right?**

### In a Nutshell

You will be able to build your own food dispenser by following these simple step-by-step instructions. The dispenser is basically just some cardboard and a servo motor with some added Arduino magic.

Using the Arduino Cloud Dashboard, you can set the amount of food to be dispensed and trigger the melodies played with the buzzer.

A light sensor is used to detect if the cat reacted to the melody and got to the food.

### Setting up the Arduino Cloud

If you are new to the Arduino Cloud, check out our [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/iot-cloud-getting-started).

### Template

To connect your board to the Arduino Cloud, we will use the [Pavlov's Cat Template](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/templates/pavlovs-cat). This template installs a specific sketch on your board and creates a dashboard that allows you to interact with your board: you don't need to write any code at all! 

See the image below to understand how to set it up.

![Thing overview](assets/template_overview.png)

**We will start by setting up the Arduino Cloud by following the steps below:**

* **Login** to your Arduino Create account
* Creating a **Thing**
* Attaching a **Device**
* Adding **Variables**
* Adding **Network** credentials

![Arduino IoT Bundle](assets/palvov-cat-01_FHBOz5Z3MA.gif)

### Variables

We wills start by adding four variables:

![Arduino IoT Bundle](assets/screenshot_2022-11-23_141459_JVW8zmmeP0.png)

### Setup Hardware & Sketch

**Play the Song**

The next section explains how to play a melody using a piezo buzzer and your Arduino.

![Arduino IoT Bundle](assets/piezo_buzzer_rp2040_whR92Z3Wgx.png)

Connect the buzzer to **digital pin 7**, as shown in the picture above. Now, navigate into the Arduino Cloud Editor through **Thing > Sketch tab** This will open up our automatically generated sketch in the Arduino Cloud Editor. Next we need to add an extra tab containing all the necessary notes to play the song. Click the arrow on the right side to add a new tab called `"pitches.h"`. See the GIF below for more detailed steps:


![Arduino IoT Bundle](assets/palvov-cat-02.gif)

Paste the following code into `"pitches.h"`.

/* notes in the melody */
int melodyOne[] = {
NOTE_C4, NOTE_G3, NOTE_G3, NOTE_A3, NOTE_G3, 0, NOTE_B3, NOTE_C4
};
/* note durations: 4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc. */
int noteDurationsOne[] = {
4, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
};
int melodyTwo[] = {
NOTE_C5, NOTE_C5, NOTE_A4, NOTE_C5, 0, NOTE_G4, NOTE_C5, NOTE_F5, NOTE_E5, NOTE_C5, NOTE_C5
};
/* note durations: 4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc. */
int noteDurationsTwo[] = {
2, 2, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 , 4
};
```

Now, we need to go back to our main sketch to play the melody. In order to use the notes we need to add `#include "pitches.h"` at the top of our code.

Inside **setup()** we need to add our **buzzerPin** as **Output.** At the bottom of the code we will add a function called **playMelody()** with three parameters: **melody,durations** and **numberOfNotes.**

To test our melody we can call the playMelody function inside **loop()** with our parameters in place.

```arduino
void loop() {
  playMelody(melodyOne, noteDurationsOne, 8);
  delay(5000);
}
```

Copy the code below to test the melody

```arduino
#include "thingProperties.h"
#include "pitches.h"
int buzzerPin = 7;
void setup() {
  /* Initialize serial and wait for port to open: */
  Serial.begin(9600);
  /* This delay gives the chance to wait for a Serial Monitor without blocking if none is found */
  delay(1500);
  pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
  /* Defined in thingProperties.h */
  initProperties();
  /* Connect to Arduino Cloud */
  ArduinoCloud.begin(ArduinoIoTPreferredConnection);
  
/*
The following function allows you to obtain more information
related to the state of network and IoT Cloud connection and errors
the higher number the more granular information youâ€™ll get.
The default is 0 (only errors).
Maximum is 4
*/
setDebugMessageLevel(2);
ArduinoCloud.printDebugInfo();
}
void loop() {
  ArduinoCloud.update();
  playMelody(melodyOne, noteDurationsOne, 8);
  delay(5000);
}
void playMelody(int melody[], int noteDurations[], int numberOfNotes ) {
  Serial.println("Playing melody");
  for (int thisNote = 0; thisNote < numberOfNotes; thisNote++) {
  /* to calculate the note duration, take one second divided by the note type.
  e.g. quarter note = 1000 / 4, eighth note = 1000/8, etc. */
  int noteDuration = 1000 / noteDurations[thisNote];
  tone(buzzerPin, melody[thisNote], noteDuration);
  /* to distinguish the notes, set a minimum time between them.
  the note's duration + 30% seems to work well */
  int pauseBetweenNotes = noteDuration * 1.30;
  delay(pauseBetweenNotes);
  /* stop the tone playing */
  noTone(buzzerPin); 
  }
}
/*
Since Notification is READ_WRITE variable, onNotificationChange() is
executed every time a new value is received from IoT Cloud.
*/
void onNotificationChange()  {
/* Add your code here to act upon Notification change */
}
/*
Since SendData is READ_WRITE variable, onSendDataChange() is
executed every time a new value is received from IoT Cloud.
*/
void onSendDataChange()  {
/* Add your code here to act upon SendData change */
}
/*

*/
void onPortionChange()  {
/* Add your code here to act upon Portion change */
}
/*
Since Melody is READ_WRITE variable, onMelodyChange() is
executed every time a new value is received from IoT Cloud.
*/
void onMelodyChange()  {
/* Add your code here to act upon Melody change */
}
```

**Detect the Cat!**

In order to detect the presence of the cat we will use a **phototransistor**, which is able to measure the light intensity and therefore if someone has passed close to it. Connect the sensor to the **A0 pin** as shown below.

![Arduino IoT Bundle](assets/light_rp2040_w373rVgQAw.png)

**Note that we used a 220 ohm resistor.**

To read values from the sensor we will only need to assign a **variable** to **analogRead(A0)**. Since we are interested in detecting the cat presence only after the melody, and just for a certain amount of time we can use the following logic:

```arduino
#include "thingProperties.h"
#include "pitches.h"
int buzzerPin = 7;
unsigned long timer;
bool startDetecting = true;
int threshold = 200;
void setup() {
  /* Initialize serial and wait for port to open: */
  Serial.begin(9600);
  /* This delay gives the chance to wait for a Serial Monitor without blocking if none is found */
  delay(1500);
  
  pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
  timer = millis();
  
  /* Defined in thingProperties.h */
  initProperties();
  
  /* Connect to Arduino Cloud */
  ArduinoCloud.begin(ArduinoIoTPreferredConnection);
/*
The following function allows you to obtain more information
related to the state of network and IoT Cloud connection and errors
the higher number the more granular information youâ€™ll get.
The default is 0 (only errors).
Maximum is 4
*/
setDebugMessageLevel(2);
ArduinoCloud.printDebugInfo();
}
void loop() {
  ArduinoCloud.update();
  
  if (startDetecting) {
    int value = analogRead(A0);
    if (value < threshold) {
      Serial.println("cat detected!");
      startDetecting = false;
    } else if (millis() - timer < 12000) {
      Serial.println("no cat detected in the past two minutes");
      startDetecting = false;
    }
  }
}
void playMelody(int melody[], int noteDurations[], int numberOfNotes ) {
  Serial.println("Playing melody");
  for (int thisNote = 0; thisNote < numberOfNotes; thisNote++) {
  /* to calculate the note duration, take one second divided by the note type.
  e.g. quarter note = 1000 / 4, eighth note = 1000/8, etc. */
  int noteDuration = 1000 / noteDurations[thisNote];
  tone(buzzerPin, melody[thisNote], noteDuration);
  /* to distinguish the notes, set a minimum time between them.
  the note's duration + 30% seems to work well */
  int pauseBetweenNotes = noteDuration * 1.30;
  delay(pauseBetweenNotes);
  /* stop the tone playing */
  noTone(buzzerPin); 
  }
}
/*
Since Notification is READ_WRITE variable, onNotificationChange() is
executed every time a new value is received from IoT Cloud.
*/
void onNotificationChange()  {
/* Add your code here to act upon Notification change */
}
/*
Since SendData is READ_WRITE variable, onSendDataChange() is
executed every time a new value is received from IoT Cloud.
*/
void onSendDataChange()  {
/* Add your code here to act upon SendData change */
}
/*
Since Portion is READ_WRITE variable, onPortionChange() is
executed every time a new value is received from IoT Cloud.
*/
void onPortionChange()  {
/* Add your code here to act upon Portion change */
}
/*
Since Melody is READ_WRITE variable, onMelodyChange() is
executed every time a new value is received from IoT Cloud.
*/
void onMelodyChange()  {
/* Add your code here to act upon Melody change */
}
```

Note that we use themillis()function to set a timer. `millis()` gives us the time in milliseconds since the board was up and running. We can use it to set timers and trigger events after a certain amount of time.

**We also use a threshold** to determine if the cat was detected. That threshold is arbitrary, you can set it according to your light condition.

**Add the Servo Motor**

> **Note:** for the servo motor you will need a 9V battery which is not included in the IoT Bundle! Alternatively you can use another external power supply such as a phone charger with open ended cables.

The servo is used to open the box and deliver food. Note that we will use the portion variable to set the amount of time the servo has to remain turned 90 degrees. We will be able to change the portion value through the Arduino Cloud Dashboard.

![Arduino IoT Bundle](assets/servo_motor_rp2040_PAcv0Yejb2.png)

Attach the **servo** to **pin 6** as shown above. To control the will make us of the servo library by adding `#include "servo.h"` at the top. We also need to initialize a variable setting the starting position of the servo by adding `Servo myservo` under our libraries and inside `setup()` add `myservo.attach(6)` which tells the program which pin we are using.

Inside the **loop()** function we also need to change some things as we put the project together. We only want to dispense food if the portion size is set and the melody has been played. We also want to start detecting if a cat is approaching and log the time it needed to arrive to the serial port.

Finally, we can add a function below `playMelody()` called `moveServo()`.

```
#include "thingProperties.h"
#include "pitches.h"
#include "Servo.h"
Servo myservo;
int pos = 0;
int buzzerPin = 7;
unsigned long timer;
bool startDetecting = true;
int threshold = 200;
void setup() {
  /* Initialize serial and wait for port to open: */
  Serial.begin(9600);
  /* This delay gives the chance to wait for a Serial Monitor without blocking if none is found */
  delay(1500);

      if (portion > 0) { /* if Melody AND food */
        notification = "Dispensing " + String(portion) + " portion of food       right   now"; /* notification of dispensed food */
        playMelody(melodyOne, noteDurationsOne, 8);
        moveServo();
        startDetecting = true;
        timer = millis();
    } else if (portion == 0) { /* if Melody and NO food */
        notification = "At your command";
        playMelody(melodyTwo, noteDurationsTwo, 11);
        startDetecting = true;
        timer = millis();
      }
   } else if (!melody) {
       notification = "Hello! \n Please turn the melody ON to train your cat";
    }
}
if (startDetecting) {
  int value = analogRead(A0);
  if (value < 200) {
    String TimeValue = String((millis() - timer) / 1000);
    notification = "Cat detected! \nTime to reach the feeder: " + TimeValue + " seconds";
    startDetecting = false;

### Dashboard

The final step to deploying our project is adding a control panel using the Arduino IoT Dashboards. We can navigate to **Dashboards > Build Dashboard > ADD**, then we can add four widget and link them to the variable as the following:

* Messenger widget -> notification variable
* Slider widget -> portion variable
* Push button widget -> sendData variable
* Switch widget -> melody variable
