Learn electronics and coding with the Arduino Starter Kit R4, built around the UNO R4 WiFi. Featuring a 32‑bit Arm® Cortex®‑M4, integrated Wi‑Fi® and Bluetooth® LE, and a built‑in 12×8 LED matrix, the kit includes curated components (sensors, LEDs, LCD, motor, servo, and more) plus a printed book with 14 projects and additional online modules—so you can prototype real IoT ideas using the Arduino IDE or Arduino Cloud.
