<FeatureDescription>

The Arduino Matter Discovery Bundle is designed to help you build smart, interoperable devices with ease. Matter is designed to reduce vendor lock-in and improve interoperability across smart home ecosystems, helping your projects work with platforms such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home™, Apple HomeKit™, Home Assistant, and more. The bundle combines the power of the Nano Matter board with the convenience of plug-and-play Modulino nodes and a versatile carrier, all backed by a comprehensive learning curriculum to help you go from idea to working prototype.
