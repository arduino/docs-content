<Feature title="Nano Matter Board with Headers" image="mkr-form-factor">
At the core is the Nano Matter with pre-mounted headers for easy setup. It features the Silicon Labs MGM240S microcontroller with a Cortex-M33, 1536 kB Flash, and 256 kB RAM. It supports Thread®, Bluetooth® Low Energy 5.3, and Bluetooth® Mesh, making it ready for Matter-compatible smart home connectivity. Includes Secure Vault® High security and USB-C connector for debugging.
</Feature>

<Feature title="Nano Connector Carrier" image="connection">
A plug-and-play carrier board that turns your ideas into working projects in minutes. It features QWIIC connectors, headers for the Nano Matter, Grove interfaces (Analog/Digital, I2C, UART), SD card reader, and allows switching between 3.3V and 5V I/O voltage.
</Feature>

<Feature title="Modulino Nodes" image="connection">
Three included Modulino boards to jumpstart your projects:
- **Modulino Latch RELAY**: Control external devices at higher voltage (24V - 6A).
- **Modulino DISTANCE**: Time-of-Flight Proximity Sensor (0 to 1200 mm).
- **Modulino THERMO**: Temperature and Humidity Sensor.
All feature QWIIC connectors for easy integration.
</Feature>

<Feature title="Academy Matter Course" image="education">
A 7-chapter hands-on curriculum tailored for embedded engineers, hardware designers, and makers. Learn to design and deploy robust, scalable IoT devices, from setting up the board to deploying a Matter® network and evaluating Matter® for your product.
