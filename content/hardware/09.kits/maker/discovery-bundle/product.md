Build smarter and prototype faster with the Arduino Matter Discovery Bundle — an easy way to start creating interoperable IoT devices using **[Matter®](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/)**, the industry-backed standard supported by Apple, Google, Amazon, Home Assistant and others. The box includes a Matter-compatible Arduino Nano, three sensor/actuator modules, and a plug-and-play carrier, plus a 7-chapter curriculum to help you go from idea to working prototype and start debugging quickly with the board's debugging over USB.
