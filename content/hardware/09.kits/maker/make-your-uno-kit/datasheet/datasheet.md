### Solution Overview
The **Arduino Make Your UNO kit** contains different boards. Besides the **UNO** board, the kit contains two additional small boards that helps the user to learn to solder its first components before starting to solder the main board. The small board with the heart shape is just for practising and it does not have any circuit or utility while the small board that contains the LED and the resistor can be powered with a 9V battery to turn on the LED.

### Processor
The Main Processor is an ATmega328P running at up to 20 MHz. Most of its pins are connected to the external headers, however, some are reserved for internal communication with the USB Bridge coprocessor (**ATMega16U2**) inside the **USB-C® Serial PCB Board**.

### Power Tree

![Make Your UNO main board power tree](assets/powerTree.svg)

### Board Operation
#### Official Instructions
The official documentation provided by Arduino to solder the entire kit is hosted at <ins>[https://makeyouruno.arduino.cc](https://makeyouruno.arduino.cc/)</ins>

#### Getting Started - IDE
If you want to program your **UNO** while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE [1]. To connect the **UNO** to your computer, you’ll need a USB-C® cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.

#### Getting Started - Arduino Web Editor
All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Web Editor [2] by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Web Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow [3] to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

#### Getting Started - Arduino IoT Cloud
All Arduino IoT-enabled products are supported on Arduino IoT Cloud which allows you to log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business. In the case of the **UNO** and the **Make Your UNO** boards, you will need additional hardware to connect them to the cloud.

#### Sample Sketches
Sample sketches for the **UNO** can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino IDE.

#### Online Resources
Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on ProjectHub [4], the Arduino Library Reference [5] and the online store [6] where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.

### Mechanical Information
#### Board Outline & Mounting Holes
The **Arduino Make Your UNO kit** shares with the standard **UNO** boards the same shape and external mechanical board outline. The most important difference is the new USB-C® connector instead of the classical USB Type-B one. The external shape and dimensions, pin headers, mounting holes and jack barrel connector are located in the same place as a standard **UNO** board, being compatible with most of the shields and peripheral devices done for the **UNO** board.

## The Audio Synth Shield
The kit comes with an **Audio Synth Shield** that can be attached to the **Arduino Make Your UNO** to learn about and experiment with audio synthesizers. The shield has six trimmers to control different audio signal parameters plus a mono amplifier that can be connected to the 8 ohm speaker that comes with the kit or to any other audio output.
