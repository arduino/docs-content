### Power Specifications

#### Supply Options

Power for the Arduino® UNO R4 WiFi can be supplied through either the VIN pin or the USB-C® connector.

- **VIN Pin:** When power is supplied via the VIN pin, the ISL854102FRZ buck converter reduces the voltage to 5 V. This input is protected by Schottky diodes for reverse polarity and overvoltage protection.

- **USB-C Connector:** Power supplied via the USB-C connector provides approximately 4.7 V to the RA4M1 MCU, accounting for the voltage drop due to the Schottky diodes.

#### Power Tree

The power distribution system ensures proper voltage levels for all components. The ISL854102 buck converter and SGM2205 regulator manage voltage regulation. Diodes for protection are also represented.

![Arduino® UNO R4 WiFi power tree](assets/UNO_R4_WiFi_Power_Tree.png)

#### Pin Specifications

The general operating voltage for UNO R4 WiFi is 5 V while the ESP32-S3 module's operating voltage is 3.3 V.

It is very important that ESP32-S3's pins (3.3 V) do not come in contact with any of the RA4M1's pins (5 V), as this may damage the circuits. The GPIOs on the R7FA4M1AB3CFM#AA0 microcontroller can safely handle up to 8 mA of current. Never connect devices that draw higher current directly to a GPIO as this may damage the circuit. For powering e.g. servo motors, always use an external power supply.

| **Specification**     | **Details**    |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| Dimensions            | 140x140x1.6 mm |
| Holes size (diameter) | 3.5 mm         |

#### I2C Side Connectors

All Modulino® nodes have at least two 4-pin surface mount connectors from the JST SM Series with a 1.0 mm pitch. These connectors are used to connect nodes between them and to the microcontroller.


#### I2C Address Reference

Each Modulino® node of the kit is designed to be connected to the Arduino® UNO R4 WiFi microcontroller using the Qwiic connectors available on both sides of the Modulino® nodes. The first node is connected to the microcontroller while the rest are connected to the latest one creating a physical "daisy-chain" connection that, from the communication point of view, is an I2C bus line where all the devices are connected acting the Arduino® UNO R4 WiFi as the controller and the Modulino® nodes as the targets.

In the case multiple nodes of the same kind are connected to the I2C "daisy-chain", they may have the same I2C default address, causing communication problems. All Modulino® nodes are designed to have the possibility of having different I2C addresses via hardware or firmware changes as presented in the following table.

| **Board Silk Name**    | **Sensor/Actuator**     | **Modulino I2C Address (HEX)** | **Editable Addresses (HEX)**                    | **Hardware I2C Address (HEX)** |

| MODULINO BUZZER        | PKLCS1212E4001          | 0x3C                          | Any custom address (via software configuration)| 0x1E                         |
| MODULINO KNOB          | PEC11J-9215F-S0015      | 0x76                          | Any custom address (via software configuration)| 0x3A                         |
| MODULINO PIXELS        | Eight LC8822-2020       | 0x6C                          | Any custom address (via software configuration)| 0x36                         |
| MODULINO BUTTONS       | Three SPST Push Buttons | 0x7C                          | Any custom address (via software configuration)| 0x3E                         |

**Please note:** When scanning for I2C addresses connected to the bus, the boards might identify themselves using the **Hardware I2C Address** listed in the last column of the table. However, you should always use the **Modulino I2C Address** provided in your code if using the official Modulino library.

With the provided software, users can change the default I2C address of the dedicated I2C interface controller firmware. Assigning different addresses allows users to connect multiple boards of the same type in a chain.
To facilitate this, a white rectangle is positioned on the bottom silk of the board, where users can write the new I2C address directly on the board itself.

<div style="background-color: #FFCCCC; border-left: 6px solid #FF0000; margin: 20px 0; padding: 15px;">
<strong>Note:</strong> The maximum number of Modulino® nodes that can be connected together using this configuration is dependent on the power source and total consumption of the system plus the total length of the cables used. In our tests the maximum number of Modulino® nodes connected together and powered via the USB Type-C of the microcontroller is approximately 50 nodes.
</div>


### Modulino® Nodes With Dedicated I2C Interface Controller

These nodes use an additional chip to handle I2C communication when there is a lack of native I2C support, ensuring the experience is consistent across every Modulino® node within the Plug and Make Kit.

#### Pull-up Resistors

These nodes have pads for optional I2C pull-up mounting in both data lines to avoid communication problems in case the I2C bus is not working as it should. No resistors are mounted by default but in case the resistors are need 4.7 K resistors in an SMD 0402 format are recommended.

These are positioned near the Qwiic connector on the power LED side except on the Modulino® Buttons where it can be found between the button B and C.

## Device Operation

### Getting Started - IDE

If you want to program your Arduino® Plug and Make Kit while offline you need to install the Arduino® Desktop IDE **[1]**. To connect the **Arduino® UNO R4 WiFi** to your computer, you will need a USB-C® cable, which can also provide power to the board, as indicated by the LED (DL1).

### Getting Started - The Plug and Make Kit

To learn more about how to use this kit and quickly build useful and interesting projects with it, please refer to the dedicated course available at **[2]** as well as the official documentation **[3]**.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud Editor

All Arduino® boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino® Cloud Editor **[4]**, by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino® Cloud Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[5]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud

All Arduino® IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino® Cloud which allows you to log, graph, analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Online Resources

Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on ProjectHub **[6]**, the Arduino® Library Reference **[7]**, and the online store **[8]**; where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.

### Board Recovery

All Arduino® boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB, it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after the power-up.
