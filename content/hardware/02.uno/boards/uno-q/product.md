The Arduino UNO Q unlocks a new level of performance for the Arduino ecosystem, blending robust computing power from Qualcomm's advanced Dragonwing™ QRB2210 MPU running a full Debian Linux OS with upstream support, and the real-time responsiveness of a dedicated STM32U585 MCU running Arduino sketches over Zephyr OS - all on a single-board computer.
