<FeatureDescription>

The **Arduino® UNO Q** integrates the Qualcomm® QRB2210 Microprocessor (MPU), running a full Debian-based Linux environment, with the STMicroelectronics® STM32U585 Microcontroller (MCU) built on Arm® Cortex®-M33 architecture, all within the compact UNO form factor. This dual-architecture platform combines high-performance computing with deterministic real-time control, delivering the power and versatility needed for modern AI at the edge applications.

Unlock hybrid development with Arduino App Lab, seamlessly uniting Python applications, Arduino sketches, and AI models in a single workflow. From AI-powered vision and sound solutions that react intelligently to their environment to sophisticated smart home systems, UNO Q with Arduino App Lab delivers next-generation embedded innovation to makers, educators, and professionals alike. At the same time, developers enjoy true freedom of choice: program the MCU subsystem with the Arduino IDE, or integrate Arduino CLI into existing workflows with popular editors like VS Code.
