description: 'Set up a simple chat server htat distributes any incoming messages to all connected clients.'
---

A simple server that distributes any incoming messages to all connected clients.  To use, open a terminal window, Telnet to your devices IP address, and type away.  Any incoming text will be sent to all connected clients (including the one typing). Additionally, you will be able to see the client's input in your serial monitor as well.

## Hardware Required

- Arduino Board

- [Arduino Ethernet Shield](https://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoEthernetShield)

## Circuit

The Ethernet shield allows you to connect a WizNet Ethernet controller to the Arduino boards via the SPI bus. It uses pins 10, 11, 12, and 13 for the SPI connection to the WizNet.  Later models of the Ethernet shield also have an SD Card on board. Digital pin 4 is used to control the chip select pin on the SD card.

The shield should be connected to a network with an ethernet cable.  You will need to change the network settings in the program to correspond to your network.

 Chat Server

 A simple server that distributes any incoming messages to all

 connected clients.  To use, telnet to your device's IP address and type.

 You can see the client's input in the serial monitor as well.
