description: 'Connects to a Telnet server using an Ethernet shield. Messages from the server are printed out via the serial port.'
---

This example connects to a Telnet server using an Ethernet shield.  Messages from the server are printed out via the serial port. Messages can be sent to the remote server serially as well. The Serial Monitor works well for this purpose.

This version attempts to get an IP address using DHCP. An IP address can be assigned via DHCP when Ethernet.begin(mac) is called. Be careful, when using the DHCP extensions, sketch size increases significantly.

## Hardware Required

- Arduino Board

- [Arduino Ethernet Shield](/hardware/ethernet-shield-rev2)

## Software Required

- A telnet server

- Alternatively, [Processing](http://www.Processing.org) has a ChatServer example that works well for this purpose

## Circuit

The Ethernet shield allows you to connect a WIZNet Ethernet controller to the Arduino boards via the SPI bus. It uses the ICSP header pins and pin 10 as chip select for the SPI connection to the Ethernet controller chip. Later models of the Ethernet shield also have an SD Card on board. Digital pin 4 is used to control the chip select pin on the SD card.

The shield should be connected to a network with an Ethernet cable.  You will need to change the network settings in the program to correspond to your network.

 DHCP Chat  Server

 A simple server that distributes any incoming messages to all

 connected clients.  To use, telnet to your device's IP address and type.

 You can see the client's input in the serial monitor as well.

 Using an Arduino Wiznet Ethernet shield.
