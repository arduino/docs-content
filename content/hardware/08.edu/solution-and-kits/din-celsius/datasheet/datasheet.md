## Heating Circuits
The board provides two independent heating circuits powered by 24 V through two different screw connector, one placed on the left side of the temperature sensor and the other on the right side. You can see how it works in the following image:

![heater](assets/Celsius-heater_func.png)

The heat is generated by the current passing through four resistors in series, and the power is about 120 mW per circuits.

## Temperature Sensor

The temperature sensor is the TMP236A2DBZR from Texas Instruments, [here](assets/tmp236-datasheet.pdf) you can find the datasheet of the component, look for the TMP236 and not TMP235. 
Here you can see its main characteristc:

 - analog out 19. 5mV/°C
 - 400 mV at 0 °C
 - accuracy max +-2.5 °C 
 - -10 °C to 125 °C Vdd 3.1 V to 5.5 V

In order to create an analog output signal (0 - 10 V) a 4.9 multiplier circuits has been added before the OUTPUT VOLTAGE screw connector pin.

The relation between the temperature, the voltage of the sensor and the output voltage of the board is summarized in the following table:

| TEMPERATURE [°C] | SENSOR OUTPUT [V] | BOARD OUTPUT x4,9 [V] |
