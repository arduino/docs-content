![Alvik's Robot](assets/alvik_main.gif)

Powered by the Arduino® Nano ESP32, Alvik offers diverse learning paths through different programming languages including MicroPython, Arduino C, and block-based coding; enabling different possibilities to explore Robotics, IoT, and Artificial Intelligence.

In this tutorial, you will find useful information to get started, test, and maintain Alvik.

## What Is Alvik


Alvik is a robot with two controllers and a wide range of sensors and actuators. The main controller is the Arduino Nano ESP32 attached to the top of the robot while there is an STM32 controller integrated into the robot that takes care of the low-level commands such as reading the sensors and moving the motors. It has been designed for STEAM education, making it an ideal tool for learning programming, Robotics, IoT, Artificial Intelligence...

### Unboxing

![Unboxing Alvik](assets/unboxing.jpg)

Inside the Arduino Alvik package you'll find the following items:

- Alvik robot
- 18650 Li-Ion battery attached to the robot
- USB-C® to USB-C® cable

### Alvik Overview

![Alvik exploded view](assets/main-components.png)

***When the PCB is out of the chassis and the battery is in place there is the risk of short-circuiting the 18650 Li-Ion battery. If you remove the hardware from the chassis make sure you do it on a __non-conductive surface clean__ of materials or tools that can short-circuit the battery.***

### Main Components

![Alvik bottom components](assets/down-components.png)

## Alvik's Brain

The **Nano ESP32** is the brain of the Alvik robot, acting as the central hub that runs the logic and makes key decisions. While it plays a critical role in processing high-level commands and overseeing the robot's operations, it doesn't directly control the motors or sensors. Instead, the Nano ESP32 communicates with the **STM32** (the body), sending instructions for actions like movement, sensor readings, or status updates. This collaboration allows the robot to perform tasks and routines based on the data it receives, enabling it to make informed decisions as we've programmed it to be.
![Alvik Brain](assets/alvik_brain.png)



### Nano ESP32

The [Nano ESP32](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nano-esp32) is the board used to control Alvik. It has a fast processor, large flash memory, and a Wi-Fi® enabled chip packed into a tiny circuit board.

***You can find out more about this board in the [Nano ESP32 documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-esp32).***

Please note that when using MicroPython the pin number reflects the GPIO on the ESP32-S3, not the Nano board. Use the **green labeled number** in the following image. You can read more about this [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/micropython/micropython-course/course/introduction-python#nano-esp32--micropython-pinout).

![Nano ESP32 pinout](assets/esp-pinout.png)

## Alvik's Body

Using the same analogy, the body of the Alvik robot includes everything else from the sensors and motors to the connectors supporting external modules and, of course, the STM32, which acts like the nervous system of the robot. Just as the human nervous system transmits signals between the brain and various parts of the body, the STM32 transmits commands and collects data from the robot's components. When the Nano ESP32, acting as the brain, sends commands, the STM32 executes these low-level operations, such as moving the motors, flashing the LEDs, or interacting with external devices. The STM32 is essential for carrying out the detailed actions based on the high-level instructions from the Nano ESP32, ensuring that the robot's movements and functions are performed accurately.

![Alvik Body](assets/alvik_body.png)


### Controller - STM32

The main core of the robot is the STM32 ARM Cortex-M4 32 Bit controller. It handles the low-level commands such as reading sensors and moving motors. You can access it through a set of dedicated APIs from the Nano ESP32.

You can learn more about the available functions for Alvik in the following [Alvik's API Documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview).

***Although Alvik's "out of the box" experience is designed in MicroPython, there are C++ APIs that allow you to program Avlik in the Arduino IDE, these APIs are 1 to 1 compatible with the MicroPython APIs, which means that the [Alvik's API Documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview) will give you information for both MicroPython and C++ programming experiences.***


The latest firmware of the STM32 can be found at [this link](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_AlvikCarrier/releases), and [here](#how-to-upload-firmware) is the guide to flash it.
![Alvik STM32](assets/alvik_STM.png)

### Header Connectors

On the top face of the Alvik, you can find 2 pairs of connectors. Both have 15 holes in length but are not interconnected. The pair on the inner side is meant for coupling the Arduino Nano ESP32, while the pair on the outside is the Power Connector, which provides optional power and mechanical support for custom expansions or circuits you might create.
![Top face connectors](assets/Connectors_Alvik_Top.png)

- **Nano Board Connector**

Because of the need to communicate with the STM board, some of the pins of the Arduino Nano ESP32 might be in use and, as such, are not recommended to be used by any other feature. This way, if you design a shield or attachment that interacts with these connectors, make sure to avoid the pins that are busy.
![ESP Pinout](assets/ESP_Pinout_Alvik.png)

- **Power Connector**

This connector allows you to get power from the Alvik's power system as well as get the power status. It also provides mechanical support for your designs. Here you can identify the connectors that can be used. Note that the remaining pins are not in use but can serve for mechanical support.
![Power Connectors on Nano ESP32](assets/Alvik_Docs_Pinout_Callout.jpg)

### ON/OFF Switch

![Switch on](assets/robot-on.png)

At the back-right side of Alvik there is the main switch of the robot. When ON the robot will power up and it will execute the already loaded program.

***Keep the robot off while programming to avoid undesired movements and remember to turn it on when you are ready to execute your program. A feature of the Arduino Lab for MicroPython terminal is that it will notify you if you forgot to switch on the robot to run the code.***

![Notification to switch on](assets/message-switch-on.png)

### Battery

The battery is a rechargeable Li-ion 18650, it allows to run Alvik for 8+ hours non stop.

When you connect your Alvik to the computer, the Nano ESP32 reports the status of the battery through the terminal of the Arduino Lab for MicroPython and with its RGB status LED. In order to see the state of the battery, you need to call the `Alvik.begin()` function in any program or directly at the command line area.

When the battery is charging the status LED will blink RED for one second.

![Charging blink](assets/charging.gif)

![Terminal notification](assets/ide-charging.png)

When fully charged it will stay GREEN.

![Alvik fully charged - Green LED](assets/charged.png)

***Don't confuse the RGB status LED with the power ON LED of the Nano ESP32, which is always green.***

To preserve the battery life of your Alvik, always store it fully charged. **We recommend charging Alvik completely between working sessions**. If you won’t be using it for an extended period, it's best to remove the battery until you're ready to use it again.

If Alvik is left unused for several months with the battery level below 20%, it may become fully depleted, leading to a voltage drop. In such cases, the battery will need to be charged externally using a compatible battery charger.


### Replacing The Battery

The battery is located in the bottom part of Alvik, if you need to access it you'll need to remove one Phillip's screw and take out the plastic holder.


![Accessing battery compartment](assets/battery_holder.jpg)

Follow the steps below to replace Alvik's battery and reset the battery management system (BMS):

1. **Turn Alvik OFF**.
2. **Remove the existing battery**: carefully take the old battery out of its compartment.
3. **Tighten the battery holder terminals** pull the + and – terminals slightly toward the center to ensure they make good contact with the battery terminals.
4. **Insert the new battery**: place the new battery into the holder, ensuring it is securely connected. To confirm proper contact, use a multimeter (set to 20V) to measure the battery holder terminals (+ & -); it should show the battery's voltage.
5. **Connect the Nano ESP32 to your computer** using the USB cable, while the Alvik switch is in OFF position.
6. **Switch ON Alvik,** like the image below.

![Charging blink](assets/charging.gif)


***Note: When Alvik is switched back ON, the charging LED indicator goes OFF.***

## Alvik's Sensors

Alvik includes a set of  different sensors listed below, all connected to the STM32 and accessible through the [APIs](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview). For each sensor there is test example program that you can find in the _examples_ folder in [this repository](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-alvik-mpy/tree/main/examples) for MicroPython and in [this repository](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_AlvikCarrier/tree/main/examples) for C++.


| **Sensor name**              | **Part name** | **Test program name** |
|------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| RGB Color detection          | APDS 9660     | read_color_sensor.py  |
| ToF 8x8 Array - up to 350 cm | LSM6DSOX      | read_tof.py           |
| IMU - 6 degree               | VL53L7CX      | read_imu.py           |
| 3x Line follower             | custom made   | line_follower.py      |
| 7x Touch sensor              | AT42QT2120    | read_touch.py         |

***Before using the ToF sensor check if it has a yellow protective film, if present, remove it from the sensor to ensure it works properly***

### Touch Buttons

The Arduino Alvik robot is equipped with seven capacitive touch buttons. These buttons allow for interactive input and can be used to control various functions of the robot, such as movement, mode selection, and more.

**Available buttons are:**
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
- Center
- OK (represented by a "`✔`" icon)
- Cancel (represented by a "`x`")

![Touch Button position](assets/touchButtons.png)

Each button can be programmed to perform specific actions, providing more complex interface for user interaction.

### Distance Sensor


The Arduino Alvik robot is equipped with a ToF (Time of Flight) 8x8 Array sensor, specifically the VL53L7CX, which can measure distances up to 350 cm. These distance sensors help the robot detect obstacles and measure the distance to objects in its environment. The sensor is integrated into the front PCB of the robot.

**Key Features:**
- Maximum distance: 350 cm
- High precision and accuracy
- Used for obstacle detection and distance measurement

![Distance sensor position](assets/distanceSensor.png)

### Line Follower Sensors


The Arduino Alvik robot is equipped with line follower sensors that help it detect and follow lines on the ground. This is useful for applications where the robot needs to navigate along predefined paths. The line follower array consists of three phototransistors and five infrared LEDs, mounted on the front PCB.

The infrared LEDs emit light towards the ground, and the phototransistors detect the reflected light. When the sensors pass over a line (typically a dark line on a light surface), the amount of reflected light changes. Dark lines reflect less infrared light compared to light surfaces, allowing the phototransistors to detect the presence of a line.

**Key Features:**
- Detects lines on the ground (or any patterns using colors or materials with different reflective properties)
- Helps in navigating predefined paths
- Consists of three phototransistors and five infrared LEDs

**How it Works:**

**Infrared LEDs**: Emit infrared light towards the ground.
**Phototransistors**: Detect the reflected infrared light.
- When over a dark line, the reflection is low, indicating the presence of a line.
- When over a light surface, the reflection is high, indicating no line.

![Follow the line sensor principles](assets/ch07-blacktape-color.png)

By continuously reading the values from the phototransistors, the robot can determine its position relative to the line and adjust its movements to follow the path accurately.

### Color Sensor

The color sensor on the Arduino Alvik robot is used to detect and identify colors on surfaces that the robot encounters. It provides both raw color readouts and labeled color information that can be used for various applications such as line following, object detection, and more. The sensor used is the APDS 9660.

**Key Features:**
- Detects and identifies colors
- Provides raw color readouts and labeled color information
- Useful for line following, object detection, and other applications

![Color sensor bottom view](assets/imageColor.png)

### IMU

The Arduino Alvik robot is equipped with an onboard IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) that provides valuable information about the robot's motion and orientation. The IMU can measure acceleration, angular velocity, and orientation. The sensor used is the LSM6DSOX.

**Key Features:**
- Measures acceleration, angular velocity, and orientation
- Provides roll, pitch, and yaw values
- Useful for motion tracking and stabilization

![IMU axis reference](assets/imageIMU.png)

## Alvik's Actuators


| **Actuator name**        | **Part name**           | **Test program name** |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Geared motors w/ encoder | GM12-N20VA-08255-150-EN | wheels_positions.py   |
| RGB LEDs                 | RGB LEDs                | leds_settings.py      |

### Motors

The Alvik is equipped with two geared motors, specifically the GM12-N20VA-08255-150-EN. These motors allow for precise and reliable movement, essential for accurate navigation and control as  each motor includes a magnetic relative encoder to ensure precise control and feedback of the motor's position.

- **Gear Ratio:** 1:150
- **Operating Voltage:** 6V
- **No-load Speed:** 55 RPM
- **No-load Current:** 70mA
- **Encoder Type:** Magnetic relative encoder
- **Magnetic relative AB encoder:** 3 ppr


### LED Indicators

![LED indicators position](assets/ledIndicator.png)

The RGB LEDs can be used for visual feedback and can be programmed to display various colors and patterns. The LEDs take in **boolean** values for each color meaning that combinations are possible by setting each color **on** or **off** .


## Out Of The Box Modes

Alvik is equipped with three ready-to-go examples. To choose one of the examples, just turn your Alvik ON, move the switch located at the bottom right corner of the robot to the right, wait until the LEDs turn blue and use the Up and Down buttons to pick one color, then hit the "tick" confirmation button. 

- **Basic Touch Programming**: Alvik’s touch buttons can control actions such as movement, changing modes, and interacting with the environment. This allows for intuitive control schemes for different applications.

- **Following Objects**: Using its distance sensors, Alvik can follow objects by maintaining a specific distance. This feature is useful for automated guided vehicles and interactive robotics.

- **Line Follower**: Alvik's line follower sensors enable it to navigate along paths marked by lines on the ground, which is great for educational purposes and demonstrating basic robotic navigation.

### Software Requirements

- Operating Systems: Linux, macOS or Windows

- [Arduino Lab for Micropython](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython)

### Updating Alvik's Brain (Nano ESP32)

It may happen that you used your Nano ESP32 for other projects than Alvik, or you need to replace it. In order to make your Nano ESP32 work with Alvik, there are few steps needed:

1. Install the MicroPython bootloader on it following [this guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/micropython/basics/board-installation/).

2. Download the Alvik Micropython libraries Alvik MicroPython libraries from the [Alvik repository](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-alvik-mpy/tree/main)
ucPack libraries from the [ucPack repository](https://github.com/arduino/ucPack-mpy/tree/main)


3. Unzip both the downloaded libraries in a single "Alvik" folder, open the Arduino Lab for MicroPython, go to the "files" tab and set the path to the unzipped folder on the Arduino Lab for MicroPython.

   ![Setting the FW path on the Labs for micropython](assets/moving_ucPack.png)

8. Now go back to the main root of the files system on the Nano ESP32. Then in your local folder navigate to the examples folder once there, select the following files and move them to the main folder of the ESP32.

   `demo.py`
   `hand_follower.py`
   `line_follower.py`
   `main.py`
   `touch_move.py`

   ![Setting the FW path on the Labs for micropython](assets/moving_examples.png)

With this last step, your Nano ESP32 has been set up with the Alvik out of the box experience and is ready to be used.

### Updating Alvik's Body (STM32)

1. Download the [pre-compiled firmware](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_AlvikCarrier/releases/latest) from the [Alvik Carrier GitHub repository](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_AlvikCarrier)

   This step will download a "firmware_x_x_x.bin" file, save it in your Alvik folder.

2. Connect your Alvik to the Computer and to the Arduino Labs for MicroPython. Then, go to the files tab and navigate to the folder where you stored the "firmware_x_x_x.bin".
   ![Setting the FW path on the Labs for micropython](assets/fw_path.png)

3. Let's move now the `firmware_x_x_x.bin` to the main root.
   ![Setting the FW path on the Labs for micropython](assets/moving_fw_bin.png)

4. Turn ON your alvik, go to the Editor tab and run the following commands by typing them and clicking on the "Play" button:

   update_firmware('./firmware_1_0_0.bin')
   ```

   ![Setting the FW path on the Labs for micropython](assets/flashing_fw.png)

After executing these commands, there will be updates of the process on the prompt, once the process finishes, the firmware of your alvik will be updated.

### Hello Alvik! Your First Program!

Alvik is intended to be programmed with MicroPyton. We recommend you to install the [Arduino Lab for MicroPython](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython) editor.

***If you're using a Chromebook, you'll need to use the [**online version**](https://lab-micropython.arduino.cc/) of Arduino Lab for MicroPython, using Chrome. You'll need to login with an Arduino account to use it.***

Now that all the previous steps have been set, let's see how to create custom programs for Alvik to move forward until detecting an object in front of it, Alvik will detect it, dodge it and continue on its way.

**1. **Create an Alvik folder in your computer and set it as the path of the Arduino Lab for MicroPython IDE.

![Adding Alvik folder path to the IDE](assets/alvik_folder_path.png)

**2. **Create a new file `obstacle_avoider.py` in your local folder.

![Creating obstacle_avoider.py file](assets/creating_file.png)

**3. **Double click on the file to open it. Once it is opened, erase the text on it and add the following code.

![Adding custom code](assets/adding_custom_code.gif)

``` python
from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
from time import sleep_ms
import sys

alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()
sleep_ms(5000)  #waiting for the robot to setup
#robot.set_illuminator(0)
distance = 10
speed = 40 #rpm

def turning():
    alvik.set_wheels_speed(0,0)
    sleep_ms(250)
    alvik.set_wheels_speed(-35,-35)
    sleep_ms(1500)
    alvik.set_wheels_speed(35,-35)
    sleep_ms(1000)

while (True):

    distance_l, distance_cl, distance_c, distance_r, distance_cr  = alvik.get_distance()
    sleep_ms(50)
    print(distance_c)

    if distance_c < distance:
        turning()
    elif distance_cl < distance:
        turning()
    elif distance_cr < distance:
        turning()
    elif distance_l < distance:
        turning()
    elif distance_r < distance:
        turning()
    else:
        alvik.set_wheels_speed(speed, speed)

```

**4. **Connect Alvik to your PC using the cable included in the box, under the tray.

![Connecting Alvik to the PC](assets/connecting_alvik.gif)

***Make sure that Alvik is OFF before connecting it to your computer.***

**5. **Once Alvik is connected to the PC, connect it to the Arduino Lab for MicroPython and open the _main.py_ file in the Alvik folder. Once the file is opened let's replace the `import demo` statement by `import obstacle_avoider`.

![Connecting Alvik to the IDE](assets/connecting_alvik_ide.gif)

***If you want to go back to the out of the box experience where you could select between reg, green and blue programs, you only need to modify the _main.py_ again replacing the `import obstacle_avoider` statement by `import demo`***.

**6. **The last step is to move the _obstacle_avoider.py_ file from the local repository to Alvik's memory.

![Moving file from local to Alvik's memory](assets/local2memory.gif)

You are now all set, disconnect Alvik from the computer, put some obstacles around Alvik, turn it ON and see how Alvik detects them and turns to avoid them.

## Deep Dive Programming Alvik


### Controlling the Motors

Movement is one of Alvik's main features, making it essential to have a variety of methods to control Alvik's motors. This flexibility allows you to use different control methods depending on your needs, whether it's for precise movement or simple speed control.

**Power Over Distance/Time**

You can set the speed of Alvik's motors directly and let it run for a specific amount of time or distance. This method is straightforward and useful for simple tasks where precise control isn't necessary.

**Function: `set_wheels_speed`**

The `set_wheels_speed` function sets the speed of the left and right motors.

**Inputs:**
- `left_speed`: The speed value for the left motor.
- `right_speed`: The speed value for the right motor.
- `unit`: Unit of rotational speed of the wheels (default is 'rpm').

**Example Usage:**

```python
alvik.set_wheels_speed(30, 30, 'rpm')
sleep_ms(2000)  # Run motors at 30 rpm for 2 seconds
alvik.brake()
```

**Distance And Angle**

Alvik allows you to control the motors based on specific distances or angles. This method provides precise control over the robot's movements, ensuring it travels the exact distance or rotates to the exact angle specified.

- `angular_velocity`: The angular speed of the wheels.

**Example Usage:**
```python
linear_velocity, angular_velocity = alvik.get_drive_speed(linear_unit='cm/s', angular_unit='deg/s')
print(f"Linear Velocity: {linear_velocity} cm/s, Angular Velocity: {angular_velocity} deg/s")
```

**Check Pose**

The `get_pose` function returns the current pose of the robot.

**Inputs:**
- `distance_unit`: Unit of x and y outputs (default is 'cm').
- `angle_unit`: Unit of theta output (default is 'deg').

**Outputs:**
- `x`: The x-coordinate of the robot.
- `y`: The y-coordinate of the robot.
- `theta`: The orientation angle of the robot.

**Example Usage:**
```python
x, y, theta = alvik.get_pose(distance_unit='cm', angle_unit='deg')
print(f"Pose - X: {x} cm, Y: {y} cm, Theta: {theta} degrees")
```

These functions allow for precise control and monitoring of the Alvik robot's movements, enabling advanced navigation and path planning capabilities.


### Reading Buttons

The Arduino Alvik robot is equipped with several touch buttons that can be used for various input purposes. The following functions are available to read the state of each button:

- Detect **any** button pressed.

    [`get_touch_any`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_touch_any) function returns true if any of the buttons is pressed.


- Detect the **OK** button pressed.

    [`get_touch_ok`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_touch_ok) function returns true if the OK button is pressed.


- Detect the **Cancel** button pressed.

    [`get_touch_cancel`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_touch_cancel) function returns true if the Cancel button is pressed.


- Detect the **Center** button pressed.

    [`get_touch_center`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_touch_center) function returns true if the Center button is pressed.


- Detect the **Up** button pressed.

    [`get_touch_up`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_touch_up) function returns true if the Up button is pressed.


- Detect the **Left** button pressed.

    [`get_touch_left`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_touch_left) function returns true if the Left button is pressed.


- Detect the **Down** button pressed.

    [`get_touch_down`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_touch_down) function returns true if the Down button is pressed.


- Detect the **Right** button pressed.

    [`get_touch_right`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_touch_right) function returns true if the Right button is pressed.


**Example**
The following example demonstrates how to read the state of each button and print its name when pressed:

```python
from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
from time import sleep_ms
import sys

alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()

while True:
    try:
        if alvik.get_touch_any():
            if alvik.get_touch_up():
                print("UP")
            if alvik.get_touch_down():
                print("DOWN")
            if alvik.get_touch_left():
                print("LEFT")
            if alvik.get_touch_right():
                print("RIGHT")
            if alvik.get_touch_ok():
                print("OK")
            if alvik.get_touch_cancel():
                print("CANCEL")
            if alvik.get_touch_center():
                print("CENTER")

        sleep_ms(100)
    except KeyboardInterrupt as e:
        print('over')
        alvik.stop()
        sys.exit()
```

This example provides a simple way to read and respond to button presses on the Arduino Alvik robot.
Feel free to expand to it by adding customized responses to each different press.


### Detecting Obstacles

These sensors provide detailed readouts from multiple positions around the robot, including **left**, **center-left**, **center, center-right**, **right**, **top**, and **bottom**. Unlike single-point sensors, these distance sensors offer comprehensive zone-based information.

![ToF Sensor top-view](assets/image.png)

The distance sensor array is divided into five distinct zones: left, center-left, center, center-right, and right. Each zone measures distances and is capable of detecting objects up to three meters away. It's important to note that while the sensors can detect objects at greater distances, the reliability of the readings may decrease.

**Read distance**

The `get_distance` function returns the distance readouts from the left, center-left, center, center-right, and right sensors.

**Outputs:**
`L`: Left sensor readout.
`CL`: Center-left sensor readout.
`C`: Center sensor readout.
`CR`: Center-right sensor readout.
`R`: Right sensor readout.

**Example Usage**

Here is an example of how to use the distance sensors to get distance measurements:

```python
from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
from time import sleep_ms
import sys

alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()

while True:
    try:
        L, CL, C, CR, R = alvik.get_distance()
        T = alvik.get_distance_top()
        B = alvik.get_distance_bottom()
        print(f'T: {T} | B: {B} | L: {L} | CL: {CL} | C: {C} | CR: {CR} | R: {R}')
        sleep_ms(100)
    except KeyboardInterrupt as e:
        print('over')
        alvik.stop()
        sys.exit()
```

In this example, the robot uses its distance sensors to measure distances in its environment. The distance readouts from the left, center-left, center, center-right, right, top, and bottom sensors are printed continuously, allowing the robot to detect obstacles and measure distances accurately.


### Following a Line

**Read line sensor**

The `get_line_sensors` function returns the line follower sensors' readouts, providing the status of the left, center, and right sensors.

**Outputs:**
- `left`: Left sensor readout.
- `center`: Center sensor readout.
- `right`: Right sensor readout.

**Example Usage**

Here is an example of how to use the line follower sensors to make the robot follow a line:

```python
from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
from time import sleep_ms
import sys

def calculate_center(left: int, center: int, right: int):
    centroid = 0
    sum_weight = left + center + right
    sum_values = left + 2 * center + 3 * right
    if sum_weight != 0:
        centroid = sum_values / sum_weight
        centroid = 2 - centroid
    return centroid

alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()

error = 0
control = 0
kp = 50.0

alvik.left_led.set_color(0, 0, 1)
alvik.right_led.set_color(0, 0, 1)

while alvik.get_touch_ok():
    sleep_ms(50)

while not alvik.get_touch_ok():
    sleep_ms(50)

try:
    while True:
        while not alvik.get_touch_cancel():

            line_sensors = alvik.get_line_sensors()
            print(f' {line_sensors}')

            error = calculate_center(*line_sensors)
            control = error * kp

            if control > 0.2:
                alvik.left_led.set_color(1, 0, 0)
                alvik.right_led.set_color(0, 0, 0)
            elif control < -0.2:
                alvik.left_led.set_color(1, 0, 0)
                alvik.right_led.set_color(0, 0, 0)
            else:
                alvik.left_led.set_color(0, 1, 0)
                alvik.right_led.set_color(0, 1, 0)

            alvik.set_wheels_speed(30 - control, 30 + control)
            sleep_ms(100)

        while not alvik.get_touch_ok():
            alvik.left_led.set_color(0, 0, 1)
            alvik.right_led.set_color(0, 0, 1)
            alvik.brake()
            sleep_ms(100)

except KeyboardInterrupt as e:
    print('over')
    alvik.stop()
    sys.exit()
```

In this example, the robot uses its line follower sensor array to navigate along a line. The `calcu2late_center` function determines the center of the line's position, and the robot adjusts its wheel speeds to stay on the line based on the calculated error from this center.

### Sensing Colors

**Available features**

1. **Calibrate** the sensor for a specific background

   The `color_calibration` function is used to calibrate the color sensor for accurate color detection. Calibration can be done against a white or black background.

   ```
   color_calibration(background: str = 'white')
   ```

   **Inputs:**
    `background`: A string specifying the background color for calibration. Can be "white" or "black".

2. Gets the **raw** sensor value

   The `get_color_raw` function returns the raw readout from the color sensor. This is the direct sensor data before any processing or labeling. It can be useful for advanced applications where precise color data is needed.

   ```python
   get_color_raw()
   ```

   **Outputs:**
 `color`: The color sensor's raw readout.

3. Gets the **labelled** sensor value

   The `get_color_label` function returns the label of the color as recognized by the sensor. This function processes the raw sensor data and converts it into a human-readable label, such as "red", "blue", "green", etc. It simplifies the use of color data for most applications however some flexibility is lost as colors are grouped into the nearest labeled color.

   ```python
   get_color_label()
   ```

   **Outputs:**
 `color`: The label of the color as recognized by the sensor. These can be:
      `'BLACK'`, `'GREY'`, `'BLACK'`, `'LIGHT GREY'`, `'WHITE'`, `'YELLOW'`, `'LIGHT GREEN'`, `'BLUE'`, `'VIOLET'`, `'BROWN'`, `'ORANGE'`, `'RED'`.

   **Example Usage**

   Here is an example of how to use the `get_color_label` function in a script that makes the robot walk in a straight line, detect three different colors (ignoring white), stop, and communicate the detected colors via serial every second:

   ```python
   from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
   import time
   from time import sleep
    
   # Initialization
   alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
   alvik.begin()
   sleep(5)  # Waiting for the robot to setup
    
   # Calibrate color sensor for white
   alvik.color_calibration('white')
    
   # Main logic
   detected_colors = set()
    
   print("Starting to move and detect colors...")
    
   try:
       while len(detected_colors) < 3:
           alvik.set_wheels_speed(20, 20)
           color = alvik.get_color_label()
           
           if color != 'WHITE' and color not in detected_colors:
               detected_colors.add(color)
               print(f"Detected color: {color}")
           
           time.sleep(0.1)  # Adjust the sleep time as needed
       
       alvik.brake()
       print("Detected three different colors. Stopping...")
       
       # Communicate the detected colors via serial every second
       while True:
           print(f"Detected colors: {', '.join(detected_colors)}")
           time.sleep(1)
   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       alvik.brake()
       print("Interrupted. Stopping the robot.")
   except Exception as e:
       alvik.brake()
       print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
   ```

4. **get_color**

   The `get_color` function returns the normalized color readout of the color sensor. This function can output the color in either RGB or HSV format.

   ```python
   get_color(color_format: str = 'rgb')
   ```

   **Inputs:**
    `color_format`: The format of the color readout. Can be "rgb" or "hsv".

   **Outputs:**
    `r` or `h`: The red component in RGB format or the hue in HSV format.
    `g` or `s`: The green component in RGB format or the saturation in HSV format.
    `b` or `v`: The blue component in RGB format or the value in HSV format.

You can use these functions depending on your needs:
- Use `color_calibration` to calibrate the sensor for accurate readings.
- Use `get_color_raw` to get the raw sensor data.
- Use `get_color_label` to get a human-readable label of the detected color.
- Use `get_color` to get normalized color data in RGB or HSV format.
- Use `hsv2label` to convert HSV values to a color label.

### Detecting Falling and Crashes (IMU)

The `get_imu` function from the [Alvik API](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_imu) returns all the IMU's readouts. The readouts include acceleration (ax, ay, az) and angular acceleration (gx, gy, gz) on the x, y, and z axes.

**Available Functions**

1. Retrieves IMU's orientation values like **roll**, **pitch** and **yaw**

   The [`get_orientation()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_orientation) function returns the orientation of the IMU, including roll, pitch, and yaw values. This can be useful for determining the robot's orientation in 3D space.

    **Outputs:**
    **r**: roll value
 **p**: pitch value
 **y**: yaw value

2. Retrieves 3-axial acceleration values

   The [`get_accelerations()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_accelerations) function returns the 3-axial acceleration of the IMU. This provides the acceleration values along the x, y, and z axes.

   **Outputs:**
    **ax**: acceleration on x
     **ay**: acceleration on y
    **az**: acceleration on z

3. Retrieves 3-axial angular acceleration values

   The [`get_gyros()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_gyros) function returns the 3-axial angular acceleration of the IMU. This provides the angular acceleration values along the x, y, and z axes.

   **Outputs:**
    **gx**: angular acceleration on x
    **gy**: angular acceleration on y
    **gz**: angular acceleration on z

4. Retrieves all IMU readouts including acceleration and angular acceleration

   The [`get_imu()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview/#get_imu) function returns all the IMU's readouts, including both the acceleration and angular acceleration values.

   **Outputs:**
    **ax**: acceleration on x
    **ay**: acceleration on y
    **az**: acceleration on z
    **gx**: angular acceleration on x
    **gy**: angular acceleration on y
    **gz**: angular acceleration on z

**Example**

Here is a combined example that utilizes all IMU functions:

```python

from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
import time

# Initialization
alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()

# Give some time for initialization
time.sleep(2)

# Get orientation
orientation = alvik.get_orientation()
roll = orientation['r']
pitch = orientation['p']
yaw = orientation['y']
print(f"Orientation - Roll: {roll}, Pitch: {pitch}, Yaw: {yaw}")

# Get accelerations
accelerations = alvik.get_accelerations()
ax = accelerations['ax']
ay = accelerations['ay']
az = accelerations['az']
print(f"Acceleration - X: {ax}, Y: {ay}, Z: {az}")

# Get gyros
gyros = alvik.get_gyros()
gx = gyros['gx']
gy = gyros['gy']
gz = gyros['gz']
print(f"Gyro - X: {gx}, Y: {gy}, Z: {gz}")

# Combine all IMU readings
imu_readings = alvik.get_imu()
ax = imu_readings['ax']
ay = imu_readings['ay']
az = imu_readings['az']
gx = imu_readings['gx']
gy = imu_readings['gy']
gz = imu_readings['gz']

print(f"IMU Readings - Acceleration: X: {ax}, Y: {ay}, Z: {az}, Gyro: X: {gx}, Y: {gy}, Z: {gz}")
```


Now that we've got a solid grasp on how the IMU works and how to interact with it, let's put this knowledge to use in a practical scenario. Events like falls and crashes are critical for a robot, as they often result from sudden changes in linear acceleration (movement along the x, y, or z axes) or angular velocity (rotational movement around these axes). By monitoring these specific changes, we can effectively detect such incidents and respond accordingly.

In the following example, we'll create a sketch that uses the IMU to identify falls and crashes. The sketch will look for sudden spikes in linear acceleration or angular velocity, using set thresholds to accurately determine when these events occur.

Here's how you can implement this functionality:
```python
from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
import time

# Initialize the Alvik robot
alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()

# Function to detect falling and crashes
def detect_fall_or_crash():
    imu_readings = alvik.get_imu()
    
    ax = imu_readings['ax']
    ay = imu_readings['ay']
    az = imu_readings['az']
    gx = imu_readings['gx']
    gy = imu_readings['gy']
    gz = imu_readings['gz']
    
    # Thresholds for detecting a fall or crash (example values)
    acceleration_threshold = 2.5
    angular_acceleration_threshold = 1.0
    
    if abs(ax) > acceleration_threshold or abs(ay) > acceleration_threshold or abs(az) > acceleration_threshold:
        print("Fall or crash detected based on acceleration!")
    
    if abs(gx) > angular_acceleration_threshold or abs(gy) > angular_acceleration_threshold or abs(gz) > angular_acceleration_threshold:
        print("Fall or crash detected based on angular acceleration!")

while True:
    detect_fall_or_crash()
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Adjust the sleep time as needed
```

Now that you've got the basics down, why not take it a step further? You can customize how Alvik reacts to falls and crashes. Whether it's sending an alert, logging the event for later analysis, or performing a recovery maneuver, the possibilities are endless. 

And let's be honest, there's a certain satisfaction in programming your robot to handle mishaps gracefully (or even dramatically). It's not just about functionality—sometimes, it's about giving our robots that extra bit of personality and, let's face it, feeling a bit superior when our creations stumble. Go ahead, have fun with it and see what creative solutions you can come up with when Alvik takes a tumble!


### LEDs

The Arduino Alvik robot comes equipped with two RGB LEDs that can be controlled to display various colors. These LEDs can be used for signaling, indicating status, or just for fun. The following functions are available for controlling the LEDs:

 **Set color** of the Alvik's RGB LEDs

   The `set_color` function sets the color of the LED by specifying the intensity of red, green, and blue components.

   **Inputs:**
    `red`: Intensity of the red component (0 or 1)
    `green`: Intensity of the green component (0 or 1)
    `blue`: Intensity of the blue component (0 or 1)

In this case the LEDs take in **boolean** values for each color meaning that combinations are possible by setting each color **on** or **off** insteadof controlling intensity.

**Example**

Here's an example sketch that cycles through different colors on both LEDs:

```python
from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
from time import sleep
import sys

alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()
sleep(5)

while True:
  alvik.left_led.set_color(0, 0, 0)
  alvik.right_led.set_color(0, 0, 0)
  sleep(1)
  alvik.left_led.set_color(0, 0, 1)
  alvik.right_led.set_color(0, 0, 1)
  sleep(1)
  alvik.left_led.set_color(0, 1, 0)
  alvik.right_led.set_color(0, 1, 0)
  sleep(1)
  alvik.left_led.set_color(1, 0, 0)
  alvik.right_led.set_color(1, 0, 0)
  sleep(1)
```

By following these steps, you can control the LEDs on the Arduino Alvik robot to display different colors and create various lighting effects.


## Talking With Other Devices!

### WiFi

The ESP32 on the Arduino Alvik robot includes built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, enabling it to connect to wireless networks and communicate with other devices over the internet. This can be particularly useful for remote control applications. In this example, we'll set up the Alvik robot to connect to a Wi-Fi network, host a web server, and provide a simple web interface with buttons to control the robot's movements.

The provided code will:
1. Connect the ESP32 to a specified Wi-Fi network.
2. Set up a web server to listen for incoming HTTP requests.
3. Serve a simple web page with buttons for directional control.
4. Move the robot in the specified direction when a button is pressed.

### Step By Step Setup

1. Replace `Insert_SSID_Here` and `Password_Here` with your Wi-Fi credentials.
2. Upload the script to the Arduino Nano ESP32.
3. Connect to the robot's IP address (printed on the console) using a web browser.
4. Use the web interface to control the robot's movement.

**Connecting to Wi-Fi**

The following code connects the ESP32 to a specified Wi-Fi network using the provided SSID and password.

```python
import network
import socket
from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
from time import sleep_ms

# Wi-Fi credentials
SSID = "Insert_SSID_Here"
PASSWORD = "Password_Here"

# Connect to Wi-Fi
sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
sta_if.active(True)
sta_if.connect(SSID, PASSWORD)

# Wait for connection
while not sta_if.isconnected():
    pass

print("Connected to WiFi. IP address:", sta_if.ifconfig()[0])
```

Replace `Insert_SSID_Here` and `Password_Here` with your Wi-Fi network's SSID and password to enable the ESP32 to connect to your Wi-Fi.

**Initializing the Robot**

The following code initializes the Alvik robot and gives it time to set up.

```python
# Initialize the robot
alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()
sleep_ms(5000)
```

**Setting Up the Web Server**

The following code defines the HTML for the web interface. Feel free to customize this to your taste.

```html
# HTML for the web interface
html = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Alvik Robot Control</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Control Alvik Robot</h1>
<form action="/up">
    <button type="submit">Up</button>
</form>
<form action="/down">
    <button type="submit">Down</button>
</form>
<form action="/left">
    <button type="submit">Left</button>
</form>
<form action="/right">
    <button type="submit">Right</button>
</form>
</body>
</html>
"""
```

We finally set up the web server, note that the selected port should be valid for your network with no conflicts. This can be tuned to the setting that best works for your network configuration.

```python
# Specify a port
port = 8080
addr = socket.getaddrinfo('0.0.0.0', port)[0][-1]
s = socket.socket()
s.bind(addr)
s.listen(5)

s.settimeout(5) 

print(f'Listening on {sta_if.ifconfig()[0]}:{port}')
```

**Handling HTTP Requests**

The following code handles incoming HTTP requests and moves the robot in the specified direction. Note that the robot will continue the action until the break is pressed.

```python
def handle_request(conn):
    try:
        request = conn.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
        first_line = request.split('\n')[0]  # Get the first line of the request
        path = first_line.split(' ')[1]  # Extract the path (e.g., "/up")

        # Strip query strings (e.g., "/up?")

            print("Connection reset by client.")
        else:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
    finally:
        conn.close()
```

**Main Loop**

The following code runs the main loop to handle incoming connections and process HTTP requests.

```python
# Main loop to handle incoming connections
try:
    while True:
        try:
            conn, addr = s.accept()
            print('Connection from', addr)
            handle_request(conn)
        except OSError as e:
            if e.errno == 116:  # ETIMEDOUT error
                print("Waiting for connection...")
            elif e.errno == 104:  # ECONNRESET error
                print("Connection reset by client.")
            else:
                print(f"Accept error: {e}")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Server stopped")
    s.close()
    alvik.stop()
```

This section ensures the server keeps running, accepting incoming connections, and handling requests until the script is interrupted. If an `EADDRINUSE` error occurs, change the port number from 80 to an unused port, like 8080, in the `addr = socket.getaddrinfo('0.0.0.0', 80)[0][-1]` line. Also, make sure the device you access the web interface on should be on the same network as the Alvik.

### ESP-NOW

The ESP32 on the Arduino Alvik robot also supports ESP-NOW, a fast, connectionless communication protocol that enables direct, quick, and low-power control of smart devices without the need for a router. ESP-NOW can work alongside Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE, making it versatile for various applications. It supports the ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-S, and ESP32-C series. In this example, we'll set up the Alvik robot to receive commands via ESP-NOW.

**Device Identification**

It is important for ESP-NOW to ensure that youknow the MAC address for your device.

You can do that by running the following code:
```python
import network

# Initialize the network interface
e = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
e.active(True)

# Get and print the MAC address
mac = e.config('mac')
print("MAC address:", ':'.join('%02x' % b for b in mac))
```
Each device will have a different address, feel free to identify your devices so that you can easily build your ESP-NOW projects.

Now that you know the address for your device we can run your first ESP-NOW project.


Lets now establish connection between a pair of Alviks. One will act as a controller and the other will follow the controls and move in the according direction.

The provided code will:
1. Initialize ESP-NOW on the ESP32.
2. Set up a callback function to handle incoming ESP-NOW messages.
3. Move the robot based on the received commands while buttons are pressed.

### Step By Step Setup


1. Upload the receiver script to the Arduino Nano ESP32 on the Alvik robot.
2. Use another ESP32 device to send commands to the Alvik robot via ESP-NOW.


**Setting Up ESP-NOW on the Receiver**

The following code initializes ESP-NOW on the receiver and sets up a callback function to handle incoming messages.

```python
from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
import network
import espnow

# Initialize ESP-NOW
wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)
esp = espnow.ESPNow()
esp.active(True)

# Print the MAC address
mac = wlan.config('mac')
print("MAC address:", ':'.join('%02x' % b for b in mac))

# Initialize Alvik
alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()

def perform_action(command):
    print(f"Performing action: {command}")
    if command == "MOVE_FORWARD":
        alvik.set_wheels_speed(60, 60)
    elif command == "MOVE_BACKWARD":
        alvik.set_wheels_speed(-60, -60)
    elif command == "TURN_LEFT":
        alvik.set_wheels_speed(-60, 60)
    elif command == "TURN_RIGHT":
        alvik.set_wheels_speed(60, -60)
    elif command == "STOP":
        alvik.brake()
    elif command == "ACTION":
        pass

print("Waiting for commands...")

while True:
    try:
        host, msg = esp.recv()
        if msg:
            print(f"Received message from {host}: {msg}")
            perform_action(msg.decode())
        else:
            print("No message received")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        alvik.stop()
        print("Script terminated by user")
        sys.exit()
```

**Setting Up ESP-NOW on the Transmitter**

The following code can be used on another Alvik to send commands to the Alvik robot.

```python
from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAlvik
from time import sleep_ms
import network
import espnow

# Initialize ESP-NOW
wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)
esp = espnow.ESPNow()
esp.active(True)

# Define the peer's MAC address
peer_mac = b'\x74\x4d\xbd\x00\x00\x00'  # MAC address of the receiver Alvik

# Try to add the peer, and handle the error if the peer already exists
try:
    esp.add_peer(peer_mac)
except OSError as e:
    if e.args[0] == -12395:  # ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_EXIST
        print("Peer already exists.")
    else:
        raise

# Initialize Alvik
alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()

# Define button to command mapping
button_commands = {
    "UP": "MOVE_FORWARD",
    "DOWN": "MOVE_BACKWARD",
    "LEFT": "TURN_LEFT",
    "RIGHT": "TURN_RIGHT",
    "OK": "STOP",
    "CANCEL": "STOP",
    "CENTER": "ACTION"
}

def send_command(command):
    esp.send(peer_mac, command.encode())
    print(f"Sent command: {command}")

print("Controller running. Press buttons to send commands.")

while True:
    try:
        if alvik.get_touch_any():
            if alvik.get_touch_up():
                send_command(button_commands["UP"])
            if alvik.get_touch_down():
                send_command(button_commands["DOWN"])
            if alvik.get_touch_left():
                send_command(button_commands["LEFT"])
            if alvik.get_touch_right():
                send_command(button_commands["RIGHT"])
            if alvik.get_touch_ok():
                send_command(button_commands["OK"])
            if alvik.get_touch_cancel():
                send_command(button_commands["CANCEL"])
            if alvik.get_touch_center():
                send_command(button_commands["CENTER"])

        sleep_ms(100)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        alvik.stop()
        sys.exit()
```

**Receiver behaviour**


1. **Initializing ESP-NOW**: The code sets up the ESP32 as a Wi-Fi station and initializes ESP-NOW.
2. **Callback Function**: A callback function `on_receive_msg` is defined to handle incoming messages. This function decodes the message and moves the robot based on the received command.
3. **Registering the Callback**: The callback function is registered with ESP-NOW to ensure it gets called when a message is received.

**Transmitter behaviour**


1. **Initializing ESP-NOW**: The code sets up the ESP32 as a Wi-Fi station and initializes ESP-NOW.
2. **Adding a Peer**: The MAC address of the receiver (Alvik robot) is added as a peer.
3. **Sending Commands**: The function `send_command` sends commands to the receiver. Example commands are provided to move the robot in different directions.

By following these steps, you'll be able to control your Arduino Alvik robot remotely using ESP-NOW, a fast and efficient communication protocol.
Feel free to tinker with this feature to add new and interesting interactions.

## Maintenance

### Check Wheels Alignment

The motion calculations performed by Alvik are based on the precise position of both wheels. You can check this position and correct it in case you think your robot is not moving as expected:

1. Place your Alvik on a side on a flat surface
2. Check that the exterior part of the wheel is in contact with the flat surface and aligned with the plastic chassis
3. Repeat with the other wheel

![Check wheel alignment](assets/wheels_alignment.png)

### Calibrate Color Sensors

To calibrate the color sensor, placed in the bottom PCB under the Nano ESP32, you'll need a white surface and a black surface. Follow these steps:

1. Open the Arduino Lab for MicroPython
2. Connect Alvik
3. Open the REPL terminal (just click on the Terminal Icon on top)

Now you're ready to send commands directly to Alvik. Every time you click enter the command will be executed in real time.

```bash
 from arduino_alvik import ArduinoAl

 alvik = ArduinoAlvi

 alvik.begin()
```

Now place your robot on the white surface and type:

```bash
alvik.color_calibration('white')
```

Now place your robot on the black surface and type:

```bash
alvik.color_calibration('black')
```

Press reset on Lab for MicroPython.

You can now test using read_color_sensor.py in the examples folder. Refer to the [test chapter](#test) if you have any problems.

***Colors are tested on paper painted using acrylic marker pens, such as UNIPOSCA, or paper printed with an inkjet printer.***

## Expanding the Robot

### Additional Connectors

Alvik includes several connectors that expand its capabilities:

- **Qwiic Connectors**
- **Grove Connectors**
- **Servomotor Connectors**
- **Lego Technic Compatibility**

![Connector positions](assets/connectorsExpantion.png)

### Qwiic Connectors

![QWIIC Connector](assets/QWIIC.png)

The Qwiic connectors on the Arduino Alvik robot are used for I2C connectivity with compatible sensors and actuators using the Qwiic standard. This standard simplifies the process of connecting multiple I2C devices by using a common connector and pinout. The Qwiic system supports daisy-chaining, allowing multiple devices to be connected in series. There are two Qwiic connectors, one on each side at the back of the robot, allowing for easy expansion and integration of additional components.

### Grove Connectors

![Grove Connector](assets/GROVE.png)

The Grove connectors on the Arduino Alvik robot are used for connectivity with compatible sensors and actuators following the Grove standard. The Grove system uses standardized connectors and pinouts to simplify the connection of various I2C devices. The system is modular and user-friendly, ideal for rapid prototyping and educational purposes. There are two Grove connectors, one on each side at the back of the robot, providing additional flexibility for expanding the robot's capabilities.

### Servomotor Connectors

![Servo Connector](assets/Servo.png)

The Arduino Alvik robot features 3-pin connectors for attaching servomotors while providing PWM control external servomotors. The connectors are disposed on a 6 by 2 header in the center at the back of the robot, supporting multiple servomotor connections. This arrangement enables complex robotic movements and functions, allowing the robot to perform a variety of additional tasks.



### Lego Technic Compatibility

Alvik's body includes compatibility with Lego Technic pieces for physical expansion and customization.


### Custom Parts

***When adding extensions to the robot, never use screws longer than 10 mm or the device could be damaged.***

![Threads for custom extensions](assets/screwThreads.png)

### Add LEGO® Addons

On both sides of Alvik there are different housings that let you add:

- 4x M3 screws per side
- 2x LEGO® Technic™ Connector per side

The dimensions are:

![Addons dimensions](assets/holes_dimensions.png)

As reference you can take a look at the following images:

![Alvik screws compatibility connectors](assets/screw_lego.png)

![Alvik LEGO® compatibility connectors](assets/lego.png)

### Add Servo Motors

The servo motors connectors are placed at the back of Alvik, in this tutorial we'll attach a servo motor to the port A. You can take a look at the pinout image in the [pinout](#3.2.7-connectors) chapter.

***The port provides 5 Volt to the motor, so be sure to connect a servo that runs with 5V.***

1. Connect the servo motor to the upper port
![Servo connected](assets/servo_connection.png)

2. Open the Arduino Lab for MicroPython

3. Connect Alvik with a USB cable and click CONNECT

alvik = ArduinoAlvik()
alvik.begin()

while True:
    # Moves servo
    alvik.set_servo_positions(0,0)
    time.sleep(2)
    alvik.set_servo_positions(90,0)
    time.sleep(2)
    alvik.set_servo_positions(180,0)
    time.sleep(2)
    alvik.set_servo_positions(90,0)
    time.sleep(2)
```

5. Click on the PLAY button to run the test code

![Servo movement](assets/servo_move.gif)

If you want to understand how the command `alvik.set_servo_positions` works, you can have a look in the [API overview](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/alvik/api-overview).

### Add I2C Grove

The I2C Grove connectors are placed at the back of Alvik, in this tutorial we'll see how to scan a generic I2C device connected to it. You can take a look at the pinout image at [Alvik's Product Page](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/alvik).

1. Connect the I2C Grove device to one of the two ports.

2. Open the Arduino Lab for MicroPython

3. Connect Alvik with a USB cable and click CONNECT

4. Turn ON Alvik

5. Copy and paste the following test code

```python
from machine import I2C
from machine import Pin

i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(12, Pin.OUT), sda=Pin(11, Pin.OUT))

print()
print('Scan i2c bus...')
print()

devices = i2c.scan()

if len(devices) == 0:
    print("No i2c device !")
else:
    print('i2c devices found:',len(devices))
print()

for device in devices:
    print("Decimal address: ",device," | Hexa address: ",hex(device))

print()
```

6. Click on the PLAY button to run the test code

7. Look at the terminal to see the list of the I2C devices

### Add Qwiic

The Qwiic connectors are placed at the back of Alvik, for this example we'll be using the Qwiic OLED display from SparkFun. You can take a look at the pinout image in the [pinout](#3.2.7-connectors) chapter](#connectors).

![Qwiic OLED display](assets/qwiic_oled.png)

1. Connect the OLED display to one of the Qwiic connectors, you can use either the left one or the right one.

![Qwiic OLED display](assets/qwiic_connection.png)

2. We've prepared the example code and the libraries in [this](assets/qwiic_display.zip) zip file.

3. Extract the files and open the folder

4. Install mpremote

[mpremote](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html) is a Python module needed to upload files on the Nano ESP32. The minimum suggested mpremote release is 1.22.0. Be sure to have Python installed before proceeding!

```
(venv)$ pip install mpremote
```

or

```
(venv)$ python3 -m pip install mpremote
```

Depending on how you configure Python on your machine.

5. Install library

Run the following line to upload all files and download the dependencies needed to run the Arduino Alvik MicroPython library.


Linux
```
$ ./install_oled_lib.sh -p <device port>
```
Windows
```
> install_oled_lib.bat -p <device port>
```

The `<device port>` is the name of the USB port that your computer assigned to the Nano ESP32. There are several ways to find it, depending on your Operating System, for example:

 You can use the Arduino IDE to know the port by [following this guide](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4406856349970-Select-board-and-port-in-Arduino-IDE).
 You can look it using the Arduino Lab for MicroPython by clicking `Connect` after have connected the Alvik with the USB cable.
 You can look at the list of the USB devices attached to the PC

6. Test `Hello World!`

Now you can open the Arduino Lab for MicroPython, connect Alvik and open the example called `hello_world.py` in the `examples` folder. If everything works as expected you'll see something like the following image:

![Hello World OLED](assets/hello.png)
