## The Board
The custom-made Braccio Carrier provides a wide range of connectivity capabilities to the Arduino educational boards. For easy to learn and play around prototyping robotic and smart automation projects in and out of classrooms, Braccio Carrier features interfaces for display, servo motors and joystick. Along with high-speed RS-485/422 and RS-232 serial communication, the carrier offers huge support for several accessories through the IO headers. In situations of long-range operations, RS-485 can support several devices on the same bus in a noisy environment. The carrier has robust electrostatic discharge protection circuitry to keep the components safe.

### Application Examples
- **Smart Automation**: The industry-standard RS-232 and RS-485/422 serial communication support for Braccio Carrier has made it possible to implement smart automation IoT projects for a wide range of projects. The low-power carrier board enables students to take advantage of the onboard connectors and play with the Arduino hardware for the enhanced learning experience.
- **Robotic Arm**: Through servo motor connector supporting up to a total of 6 motors has given a chance to demonstrate robotic application including RC Car. Some of the most interesting robotic applications with faster prototyping come from the student community for various problem statements.
- **Gaming**: Thanks to the Mini Joystick connector provided on the Braccio Carrier carrier board which facilitates the implementation of LCD gaming options. Interfacing Mini Joystick with the carrier board integrated with a powerful Arduino board can deliver some really exciting projects.

### Power Tree
![Arduino Braccio Carrier Power Tree](assets/Power_Tree_Braccio_Carrier.jpg)

## Board Operation
### Getting Started - IDE
If you want to program your Braccio Carrier while offline you need to install the Arduino Desktop IDE **[1]** To connect the Braccio Carrier to your computer, you’ll need a Type-B USB cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.

### Sample Sketches
Sample sketches for the Braccio Carrier can be found in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino IDE.

### Online Resources
Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on Project Hub **[2]**, the Arduino Library Reference **[3]** and the online store **[4]** where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.

### Board Recovery
All Arduino boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after power up.
