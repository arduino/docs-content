      About PSTI:
      The purpose of the UK PSTI is to enhance the security of connectable products and minimize cybersecurity risks associated with these products in the United Kingdom. As outlined in the Regulation, the key requirements include:
        - Each device must be equipped with a unique password, or users must be provided with the ability to establish their own.
        - The manufacturer is obligated to furnish clear instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities.

      Arduino's Password Security Protocols:
      Arduino devices, in their factory default state, are not configured with preset passwords. During the initialization process of certain features, users are granted the capability to create personalized passwords. For other critical functions, such as authentication and communication with Arduino's cloud-based services or user-hosted platforms, cryptographic keys, certificates, and/or API keys are employed.

      Reporting Security Vulnerabilities:
      To report any security vulnerabilities, please contact us here. Upon submission, a support ticket will be promptly generated, and an acknowledgment will be issued within a reasonable timeframe. Should the reported issue be validated, you will receive consistent updates until the matter is fully resolved.

Companies supplying articles containing substances of very high concern (SVHCs) on the Candidate List in a concentration above 0.1% weight by weight (w/w) on the EU market have to submit information on these articles to ECHA, as from 5 January 2021. The SCIP database ensures that the information on articles containing Candidate List substances is available throughout the whole lifecycle of products and materials, including at the waste stage. The information in the database is then made available to waste operators and consumers."
