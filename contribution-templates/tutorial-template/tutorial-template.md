Update the frontmatter above with information that fits your tutorial. Remove the section that are not relevant or filled in. Note that you **must** at least fill in the title, description and author. Remove the sections that are not filled in.

## Introduction 

Write a short introduction to the tutorial. This should be maximum three sentences long and summarize what the tutorial is about. 

## Goals

List here the goals of this tutorial. Try to keep it short, approx. 3-5 bullets. 

The goals of this tutorial are:

- 

## Hardware & Software Needed

List the hardware and software needed. This could be the IDEs, libraries but also the hardware such as the board for example. Make sure to link to whatever you are listing. 

- Arduino IDE ([online](https://create.arduino.cc/) or [offline](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)).
- [Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect](https://store.arduino.cc/nano-rp2040-connect).
- etc.

## Circuit

Add the image of the circuit here. This section should not need any text following the image, only a well thought alternative image text. 

![Well thought out alternative image text.]()

## Focus Feature

This is the **only** heading you should rename to what the feature is about. Talk about the first feature you want this tutorial to highlight. You can use step-by-step instructions, images or code snippets to show examples. You can use subheading h3 here as well. 

You can also add how many of the "Focus Feature" headings as needed, however as tutorials only focus on minimal features, we recommend to only adding a maximum of three "Focus Feature" headings.

## Programming the Board

Example code for the reader to copy and paste into their own sketch. This section should explain the different sections in the code. 

## Testing It Out

After uploading the code, we should now start using it. Go through the flow with the reader. 

### Troubleshoot

Add a bullet list of the things that could be the potential issue for something not working. 

If the code is not working, there are some common issues we can troubleshoot:

- Troubleshoot point 1
- Troubleshoot point 2

## Conclusion

Add a conclusion to what this tutorial has gone through. Connect back to what you wrote in the "Goals" section.
