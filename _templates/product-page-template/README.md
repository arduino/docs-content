## Creating a new Product Page

When creating a new product page, you should

1. Copy and paste this folder into the correct path.
2. Rename the folder to fit the product you are working on, remember to check the [product list](././../../../scripts/validation/resources/products.yml) for the correct naming.
3. Fill in the information in the different files and folders, make sure that the information in the files match the product that you are working on. There might be some sections that you need to remove because they do not fit the product you are writing about. This includes the information in the tech specs (you get this from the Technical Content Writers) as well as adding the product specific tutorials.
4. Fill in the technical reference file with relevant information. Check out the [Nano RP2040 Connect Technical Reference](/content/hardware/03.nano/boards/nano-rp2040-connect/tutorials/rp2040-01-technical-reference/rp2040-01-technical-reference.md) for inspiration.

## Things to think about:

* add the relevant images in the relevant folders
* name the product with its confirmed name, you can find that here: [product list](././../../../scripts/validation/resources/products.yml). Remember that you don't always have to include the "Arduino" in the beginning of the product name, only the first time you are mentioning it. 
  
**Note:** More information about the product page files and folders can be found in the [main README.md](README.md) file. Such as how to:

* create a new datasheet
* add new products
* add features to product pages
* write code snippets
* reference content from other folders
* use the Content Linter Tool
