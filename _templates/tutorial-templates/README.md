## How to use the Templates

When filling in the information in the tutorials, you need to respect the sections and heading levels. But don't worry, if you get anything wrong, the Linter Tool will help you out. However this means that whenever you have finished a tutorial, and it's ready for pushing to your new repo branch for reviews, you should use the Content Validation tool **before** pushing your new content. 

### How to use the Content Linter

Check out the [main README.md](/README.md) file for instructions on how to use the Linter.
