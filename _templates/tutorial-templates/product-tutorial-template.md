You can also add how many of the "Focus Feature" headings as needed, however as the tutorials only focus on minimal features - this amount should not be higher than three.-->


## Programming the Board

<!-- Example code for the users to copy and paste into their own sketch. This section should explain the different sections in the code. -->


## Testing It Out

<!-- After uploading the code, we should now start using it. Go through the flow with the user. -->

### Troubleshoot

<!-- Add a bullet list of the things that could be the potential issue for something not working. -->
