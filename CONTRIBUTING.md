# Contributing to Arduino Documentation

The docs.arduino.cc website is built from the Markdown sources hosted in this repository.

## How to Contribute

In order to contribute new or updated documentation, you must first create a GitHub account and fork the original repository to your own account. You can make changes, save them in your repository, then [make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) against this repository. The pull request will appear [in the repository](https://github.com/arduino/docs-content/pulls) where it can be assessed by the maintainers, copy edited, and if appropriate, merged.

**NOTE:** Unless you are opening a pull request which will only make small corrections, for instance to correct a typo, you are more likely to get traction for your changes if you [open an issue](https://github.com/arduino/docs-content/issues) first to discuss the proposed changes.

## Type of Content

We welcome contributions from the community, ranging from correcting small typos all the way through to adding entire new sections to the documentation. However, we are looking to keep the contents of this repository focussed on Arduino-specific things.

Contributions that are more likely to be accepted:

* Corrections of typos, broken links, wrong information
* New tutorials showing how to use features of Arduino hardware products
* Improvements to existing articles to clarify unclear concepts or add useful bits of information

Contributions that are more likely to be rejected:

* Generic project tutorials ([Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub) is the place for them)
* Duplicates of existing content
* Content that is specific to third-party services or products

## Style

We require content to be written in plain and concise language, so that both basic and advanced users can understand it. See our [Style Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/contributions/arduino-writing-style-guide) for more information about this.
